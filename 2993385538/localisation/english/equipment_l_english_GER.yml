 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_06_short:0 "Kfz. 13"
 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_06_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles never mentioned Armored Cars, so Germany started developing some highly effective Armored Cars very early. Armored Cars trade off armor and firepower in favor of higher speed and stealth. They are typically used as reconnaissance vehicles. The earlier Sd.Kfz. were quite performant in countries with good road network, while for the tougher terrain in Africa and on the Eastern Front, earlier models were hampered by their poor off-road performance."

 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_07_desc:0 "As the Kfz.13 was a road armored car, but an army specification of 1935 called for a true all-terrain variant. The German Wehrmacht was still under construction and, in secret maneuvers in the Soviet Union, it was recognized that a suitable scout car was necessary to succeed the Kfz.13. An order was therefore placed to Eisenwerk Weserhütte of Bad Oeynhausen, to study the Sd.Kfz.221. The chassis used a four-wheel drive, independent suspension and the V8 3.5L Horch (20 hp/tonne) engine was relocated to the rear."

 GER_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "The poor performances of the first, “6-rad” (six wheeled) model led to a complete redesign by Bussing-NAG, with a eight-wheeled vehicle with fully independent steering wheels and a much more powerful engine. The Büssing-NAG 8×8 truck chassis was relatively complex and costly to build, each independent wheel being independently steered and suspended. In fact, when it was first produced in 1937, this was the most advanced armored car in the world. Although some features of the former chassis and sloped bodywork were loosely kept, the biggest change was swapping the positions of the driver and engine. This allowed better visibility and control for the driver, better protection for the engine in a roomier, fully separate compartment, and more fuel was carried. The seats for the commander and gunner were attached to the hand traversed turret, which was of hexagonal shape for added internal space, but the armament was identical. There was still a reverse driver/radio operator, but the extra pair of wheels made for a far better grip and the all-independent steering wheels gave an unprecedented level of maneuverability on all kinds of terrains. In all, the 8 rad was well received by the army reconnaissance units and began to replace its predecessor in some units."

Additionally, the front hood cooling grid and the lateral access traps was removed and replaced by large open ventilation boxes, and the lower part of the hull was modified to increase the compartment draw. The rear muffler storage boxes were relocated to the rear, and the mufflers themselves were completely modified. The rearview mirror was relocated from the driver side vision slit to a lower position. The headlights were now fixed directly to the chassis and the bumpers were removed and replaced by towing hooks. \n\nWhile the ausf. C was a successful model and produced in large numbers, the design (especially the armor plates) were found to be labor-intensive by late 1942 as German war industry was starting to encounter production problems."

The number of armored panels was reduced from 19 to 9, and permanent stowage boxes with padlocked access traps were added, replacing the former rear mufflers. Simple vision slits, simple flat engine hood panels with relocated air intakes under the hull, simplified reverse sloping rear end with flat door panels and many other minor modifications allowed the simplification of construction while offering the same protection, and it was far less labor-intensive."

 GER_handheld_at_equipment_0_desc:0 "German anti-tank rifle development started in 1917, with the Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr being the world's first anti-tank rifle. Development for a anti-tank rifles resumed with the German re-armament efforts in late 1930s. In 1939, the designer B. Brauer at Gustloff Werke came up with the Panzerbüchse 38 (PzB 38). \n\nPzB 38 was a manually loaded single-shot weapon with a recoiling barrel. It used a specifically designed cartridge with a standard caliber of 7.9 mm, but a very large 94 mm long case, named 7.92x94mm Patronen. When fired, the barrel recoiled about 9 cm, which opened the breech and ejected the spent cartridge casing. The breech block was then arrested in the rear position, remaining opened for the gunner to manually insert a new cartridge. The gunner then released the cocked breech with a lever at the grip. The breech and barrel would then move forward again and the trigger was cocked in preparation to fire. This rather complicated mechanism was reportedly prone to jamming as the system got dirty in field use. \n\nAlthough manufactured with pressed steel parts that were spot-welded, because of the complicated vertical breech block mechanism it was difficult to manufacture and only a small number of (1,408) PzB 38 rifles were built between 1939 and 1940 at the Gustloff Werke plant. 62 of these weapons were used by German troops in the invasion of Poland in 1939."

 GER_handheld_at_equipment_1_desc:0 "By the time of Operation Barbarossa, anti-tank rifles were found to be too complex to manufacture in large numbers and more importantly, unable to deal with enemy armor. To address these shortcomings, Panzerfaust (lit. \"armor fist\" or \"tank fist\") was developed in 1942. It was an inexpensive, single shot, recoilless anti-tank weapon that consisted of a small, disposable pre-loaded launch tube firing a high-explosive anti-tank warhead, and was intended to be operated by a single soldier. \n\nPanzerfaust had a total weight of 5.1 kilograms and total length of 104.5 centimetres. The launch tube was made of low-grade steel 44 millimetres in diameter, containing a 95-gram charge of black powder propellant. Along the side of the tube were a simple folding rear sight and a trigger. The edge of the warhead was used as the front sight. The oversize warhead (140 mm in diameter) was fitted into the front of the tube by an attached wooden tail stem with metal stabilizing fins. \n\nThe warhead weighed 2.9 kilograms and contained 0.8 kilograms of a 50:50 mixture of TNT and hexogen explosives, and had armour penetration of 200 millimetres. The Panzerfaust often had warnings written in large red letters on the upper rear end of the tube, the words usually being \"Achtung. Feuerstrahl.\" (\"Beware. Fire jet.\"). This was to warn soldiers to avoid the backblast. \n\nFive different variants were created, named 30, 60, 100, 150 and 250, each having increased payloads respectively. Between 1942 and 1945, over 6,500,000 units of all variants were produced. Panzerfaust was highly successfull, cost-efficient and easy to use. These characteristics made it the primary weapon of the Volkssturm units in the closing stages of the war."

 GER_handheld_at_equipment_2_desc:0 "Panzerschreck (lit. \"tank fright\", \"tank's fright\" or \"tank's bane\") was the popular name for the Raketenpanzerbüchse 54 (\"Rocket Anti-armor Rifle Model 54\", abbreviated to RPzB 54), an 88 mm reusable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by Germany. The Panzerschreck development initially started in November 1942, based on the American Bazookas captured in Tunisia. The Panzerschreck was larger and heavier than its American counterpart – the Panzerschreck had an 88 mm calibre, compared to the 60 mm calibre of the bazooka – which meant that it could penetrate thicker armor, but also produced more smoke when firing. The 88 mm calibre was selected as the existing anti-tank rocket for the 8 cm Raketenwerfer 43 was reused for Panzerschreck. \n\nUnlike the rockets used in American bazookas which extinguished before leaving the tube, the RPzB rockets kept burning for about 2 metres after exiting the tube. Users were instructed to wear heavy gloves, a protective poncho and a gas mask without a filter to protect them from the heat of the backblast when the weapon was fired. Improvised shields were made to protect the user and in February 1944, the RPzB 54 was fitted with an official blast shield to protect the operator which made the weapon heavier, weighing 11 kilograms empty. Firing the RPzB generated a copious amounts of smoke both in front of and behind the weapon. Because of the weapon's tube and smoke produced, official documentation named the weapon the Ofenrohr ("stove pipe"). This also meant that anti-tank teams were revealed once they fired, making them targets and, therefore, required them to shift positions after firing. \n\nMore than 300,000 units were produced between 1943 and 1945."

In its long and troubled design history, the StG 44 was originally designated as MP 43 and later MP 44, but changed for propaganda purposes. The design aimed to combine the power of bolt-action rifles, the compactness of carbines and the fire rate of submachine guns. These requirements were created during the invasion of the Soviet Union, where increasing numbers of semi-automatic Tokarev SVT-38 and SVT-40s were used by the Red Army, while some Soviet rifle companies were completely equipped with PPSh-41 submachine guns. After experiencing high volumes of automatic fire from these weapons, German commanders re-thought their small arms requirements. Several attempts had been made to introduce lightweight machine guns or automatic rifles, but recoil from the powerful 7.92×57mm Mauser round was too difficult to control in automatic fire. \n\nBy 1941, it was becoming clear that action needed to be taken. Although various experimental rounds had been developed to one degree or another by this point, the Army instead decided to select yet a new design, the Polte 8×33mm Kurzpatrone (\"short cartridge\"). This used a spitzer bullet and basic cartridge design of the standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle cartridge, cutting down the cartridge from the original 7.92×57mm Mauser to 7.92×33mm Kurz. It was understood that this was not ideal, but it would minimize logistical problems. \n\nLate war production and logistical problems encountered by Germany resulted in only over 400,000 units were produced in four plants between 1943 and 1945. This was fewer than the 1,500,000 ordered, and far fewer than the 4,000,000 planned."

 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "After the start of hostilities and the campaigns of Poland and France, the need for a semi-automatic rifle was understood quickly. Pre-war German small arms doctrine based a squad's firepower on the machine guns, so that the role of the rifleman was largely to carry ammunition and provide covering fire for the machine gunners. It was apparent that increasing the fire rate of the rifleman of a squad would greatly enhance the combat performance of the infantry squads. \n\nIn 1940, the army called for a design for a semi-automatic rifle with three specifications. First, no holes were to be bored into the barrel for tapping gas for the loading mechanism. Second, the rifles were not to have any moving parts on the surface. Third, in case the auto-loading mechanism failed, a bolt action was to be included. Weapons manufacturers Mauser and Walther submitted rifle designs that used the same 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge with Karabiner 98k, but used the Bang system (named after its Danish designer Soren H. Bang) to enable semi-automatic fire. It had a 10-round internal magazine that was loaded with stripper clips. \n\nWhile the Mauser design, named Gewehr 41(M), fulfilled all of the army's specifications, the overall design was highly complex, unreliable, heavy (4.09 kg), and had accuracy issues. Walther's design, named Gewehr 41(W), ingored the last two specifications, but was less complex compared to Gewehr 41(M). However, it still had gas system problems and the rifle was difficult to maintain. Nevertheless, it showed enough promise for further development. \n\nOver 140,000 units were produced between 1941 and 1943."

The mechanism was clearly superior to the Gewehr 41's, and simpler as well. \n\nIn 1943, Walther produced the final design, named the Gewehr 43. The name was changed in 1944 to Karabiner 43, as the barrel was in fact 2 cm shorter than Karabiner 98k. The rifle weighed 4.4 kg and was had a length of 1,115 mm. Over 400,000 were produced until the end of the war. The rifle still used the 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge, had a detacable 10-round box magazine, but could still be loaded both with stripper clips as well.

In contrast to many other SMGs of the time, MP35's magazine was inserted from the right-hand side of the weapon. The MP35 was a blowback operated, selective fire SMG which fired from an open bolt. The weapon featured a non-reciprocating cocking handle placed at the rear of the receiver, which was operated in a similar fashion to bolt-action on a Mauser rifle. This involved the weapon carrier to manually pull the handle up, pull backwards, push forwards and lock back down. When the gun was then fired the cocking handle remained stationary. \n\nMore than 40,000 units were produced between 1935 and 1944, the main user being Waffen-SS units.

Longitudinal groovings on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing, were also removed from MP 40. MP 40 used the 9×19mm Luger Parabellum cartridge and had a detachable magazine that carried 32 rounds. A major design flaw of the MP 40 was the 32-round magazine. The MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert, unlike most other submachine guns of the period. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. \n\nVariants of MP 40 included the unreliable MP 40/I, which used dual magazines to bring to ammunition capacity near the Soviet PPSh-41.

Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire. The barrel of the MG 34 could be quickly changed to avoid overheating during sustained fire by the machine gun crew. \n\nThe MG 34 was a successful design and was in production until the end of the war even after the introduction of MG 42. Over 500,000 were produced in total. Most German tanks used the MG 34 for secondary armament, as the MG 42 was ill-suited for internal/coaxial mounting due to the method of barrel change.

While the earlier MG 34 was a successful design, its high cost in materials and construction complexity required a newer design as the war progressed and the German war industry was pushed to its limits. \n\nAmong the three companies that were asked to submit designs, Großfuß AG's proved to be the best design by far. The design employed a unique recoil-operated roller-locking mechanism whereas the other designs used a gas-actuated system. Interestingly, the company had no earlier experience in weapons manufacture, specializing in pressed and stamped steel components. Dr. Werner Gruner, one of the leading design engineers with Großfuß, knew nothing about machine guns when he was given the task of being involved with the project, although he specialized in the technology of mass production. Gruner attended an army machine gunner's course to familiarize himself with the utility and characteristics of such a weapon and sought input from soldiers. \n\nBeing made largely out of stamped appropriately hardened carbon steel metal, MG 42 required considerably less machining and fewer high-grade steel alloys containing metals that became scarce in Germany. MG 42 was much simpler to build than other machine guns — it took 75 man-hours to complete the new gun as opposed to 150 man-hours for the MG 34 (a 50% reduction), 27.5 kg of raw materials as opposed to 49 kg for the MG 34 (a 44% reduction) — and cost 250 RM as opposed to 327 RM (a 24% reduction). To simplify the design, the select-fire trigger system of MG 34 was also removed. \n\nThe cost-reducing design goals of MG 42 did not affect the weapon's effectiveness and reliability, and its rate of fire (1,200 rpm) was extremely high compared to contemporary designs. The high rate of fire had its drawbacks, however. Sustained fire depleted ammunition quickly, and the barrel would overheat and need replacement frequently. \n\nMG 42 was a very successful weapon with over 400,000 produced. Its simple and reliable design became the basis for many other machine guns of various countries."

Compared to the recoil-operated, roller-locked MG 42 mechanism, the MG 42V used a roller-delayed blowback operating mechanism. This new mechanism did not completely lock its breech before firing, therefore increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction at the same time. The barrel was a simpler part without a locking piece with a lifespan of over 10,000 rounds. The MG 42V used steel of lesser quality, reducing the weight to 9 kg. \n\nTesting started with 10 prototypes in 1944, where the MG 42V achieved a firing rate of 1,350 rpm.

The Me 264 was designed as an all-metal four-engine bomber and the fuselage was very lightly armored and carried few defensive armaments, the idea was to increase fuel capacity and range. Interest in the aircraft dwindled and the project was cancelled in September 1944. Messerschmitt then proposed a six-engine version the Me 264/6m or Me 364, but it never left the drawing board."

The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
 GER_lcarrier_2:0 "Elbe Class CVL"
 GER_lcarrier_2_desc:0 "The Jade class comprised a pair of passenger ships intended to be converted into auxiliary aircraft carriers by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The two ships were launched as Gneisenau and Potsdam in 1935 and operated in peacetime by Norddeutscher Lloyd. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting. Gneisenau and Potsdam were to be renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, the ships were intended to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters."
 GER_seaplane_tender_1:0 "Krischan Class AV"
 GER_seaplane_tender_1_desc:0 "The Krischan class was a class of seaplane tenders built for the Kriegsmarine for scouting and reconnaissance duties. Compared to other navies, german seaplane tenders were very small, carried only up to three seaplanes but had a overall higher speed of around 20 knots. Due to their small displacement of 1.000 - 2.500 long tons, the ships were faster to produce than other navies seaplane tender classes. The range of the seaplane tender classes of the Kriegsmarine was rather low due to the close distance to England and France which were considered the main enemies in a future conflict."
