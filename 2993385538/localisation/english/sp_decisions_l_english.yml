Side by side with the Red Army, the entire soviet people are rising in defense of our native land. Above all, it is essential that our people, the Soviet people, understand the full immensity of the danger that threatens our country and abandon all complacency, all heedlessness, all those moods of peaceful constructive work. The enemy is cruel and implacable. He is out to seize our lands, watered with our sweat, to seize our grain and oil secured by our labour. All our work must be immediately reconstructed on a war footing, everything must be subordinated to the interests of the front and the task of organizing the demolition of the enemy. Our forces are numberless. The overweening enemy will soon learn this to his cost. All our forces for support of our heroic Red Army and our glorious Red navy! All forces of the people - for the demolition of the enemy! Forward, to our victory!\"\n- Joseph Stalin, Premier of the Soviet Union"

There is only one thing in the lives of men, nations and countries that is without price. That thing is honor!\" \n- Józef Beck, Polish diplomat"

The United States was at peace with that nation. And, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conservation with it's government and it's emperor, looking towards the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, 7 December 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire.\"\n- Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States"
