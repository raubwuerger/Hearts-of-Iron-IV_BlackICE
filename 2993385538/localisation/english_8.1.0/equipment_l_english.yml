First used in the Desert Campaign, the idea behind squeeze bore is to use the power of the powder to forge the projectile down in diameter. This would, in theory, do one of two things: blow the gun to Kingdom Come, or accelerate the projectile to velocities previously unheard of. The sPzB 41 was succesful in reducing the caliber from 28 mm at the chamber end to only 20 mm at the muzzle, achieving velocities up to 1,400 m/s."

  tech_infantry_uniforms_camo_desc:0 "The role of uniform is not only to hide each soldier, but also to identify friend from foe. Issue of the \"Frogskin\" uniforms to US troops in Europe during the WW2 was halted as it was too often mistaken for the disruptively patterned German uniform worn by the Waffen-SS. Camouflage uniforms need to be made and distributed to a large number of soldiers. The design of camouflage uniforms therefore involves a tradeoff between camouflaging effect, recognizability, cost, and manufacturability.\nArmies facing service in different theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can to some extent be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.\nCountries in boreal climates often need snow camouflage, either by having reversible uniforms or simple overgarments. Such simple overgarments can be used for other terrains too. The Austrian and Israeli armies use solid colour field uniforms, relying on simple overgarments for camouflage."
