 TUR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The youthful Republic of Turkey has finally shaken off its historic Ottoman past. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal the old ways are being consigned to history and a newer, more modern Turkey is slowly emerging.\n\nDoes Turkeys geographical position mean that it is well placed to capitalise if war once again breaks out in Europe? Will she be able to defend herself, if attacked, by any of the major factions?"
 FIN_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The Finnish Republic looks nervously to the East. Despite a healthy recovery from the 'Great Depression' diplomatic relations with the Russian bear are starting to become strained. Rumours abound that the blood of Finnish civillians is being spilt in the former Finnish Karelian region.\n\nOur tiny nation is no match for the mighty Soviets should conflict come. Perhaps though, we can still give them a bloody nose and maybe find willing allies to help support our cause?"
 SWE_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Sweden is steadily growing its industrial base to meet demand for its steel, ball bearings and wood products. Can this fruitful Social Democratic nation ride out a potential European conflict?\n\nWould such a conflict perhaps give it an opportunity, along with its Scandinavian neighbours, to align and unite to face its common enemies?	"
 HOL_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Holland is still feeling the crippling effects of the 'Great Depression'. With growing unrest within its civilian population will the country be forced to ditch the 'gold standard' which many blame for its current woes?\n\nMeanwhile the Dutch government is heavily relying on its stated neutrality to avoid getting embroiled in European conflict, should it come."
 BEL_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Belgium may be seen by some as an insignificant territory but its position as a densely industrialized country extracting precious resources from its African colony make it a potential target for those with lofty ambitions....\n\nRecovering from the 'Great Depression' with major infrastructure projects underway it still seems that a greater number of voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Leon Degrelle is gaining popularity and may come to threaten the traditional coalitions of the democratic parties. Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading trouble amongst Flemish soldiers!"
 IRE_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The Irish Free State has managed to remain a democracy despite the growth of dictatorships within mainland Europe and the 'Great Depression'.\n\nWith a new world conflict potentially on the horizon should the nation align itself with enemies of the hated United Kingdom or should it attempt to remain neutral and try to secure independence and a united Ireland through diplomatic means?"
 SPR_NP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Born in 1931, the Second Spanish Republic is destabilized. The fall of the centrist government of Alejandro Lerroux due to corruption scandals has led to new elections in February. In the meanwhile, the government of Manuel Portela rules the country.\n\nPowered by leftist republicans and the PCE, the left-wing elements, except the anarchist CNT, have united in the Popular Front. In the meanwhile, the right is divided in monarchists, fascists and the legalist CEDA. In the edge of a civil war, consumed by violence and in need of modernization, how will Spain survive?"
 SPR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The embryonic democracy of the Second Spanish Republic is facing an uncertain future. Opposing political viewpoints means that this nation is currently a melting pot of political intrigue.\n\nWith the potential for a bloody civil war ominously looming within its own borders will it be the nationalists or the republicans who prevail to shape the immediate Spanish future?"
 POR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The Portuguese Second Republic, led by António de Oliveira Salazar is a mildly fascist corporatist state led by a single party regime.\n\nWith its only neighbour seemingly heading for civil war, how will this country react should another war break out on its borders?	"
 BMP_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"After the Great War, the area of Palestine came under British administration as a League of Nations mandate with the contradictory purpose of establishing a 'Jewish homeland' and maintaining the rights of the indigenous population.\n\nWhile the rest of the world slowly moves toward war, you, as the High Commissioner, have your own problems to worry about. In the last few years, the mandate has become increasingly agitated as the Jewish population has continued to rise, while the promises for either side have remained unfulfilled."
 JOR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"A former part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Syria, Transjordan became a British Protectorate in 1921 under Emir Abdullah and remained a faithful British ally. Having been virtually uninhabited as a desert landscape during and before The Great War, establishing statehood in Transjordan was not without its problems. Emir Abdullah had to deal with nomad tribe attacks during the 1920s, due to the fact that they didn't recognize Transjordan's statehood, nor the borders of the Sykes-Picot agreement. The attacks have stopped since 1924 and Abdullah was greatly helped by the British to achieve this feat." #Since then the country's efforts have been mainly to modernize and integrate its previously nomad population into a modern country.
 IRQ_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Born out of three former Ottoman Vilayets, Iraq first came into existence under British administration in 1920 with King Faisal and was granted independence in 1932, but with continued British presence. After Faisal's death in 1933, the country became a pressure cooker, at any moment it would blow up in a civil war. On one side the nationalists and on the other the pro-UK militants.\n\nWill you be able to restore the stability of your country? Or will you bring it to ruin?"
 BUL_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Bulgaria found itself on the losing side of the Great War. Whatever was left of the third Bulgarian Empire was destroyed by the Allied Powers and their forced demilitarization of Bulgaria. On top of demands of the Western Powers, Bulgaria's fellow Balkan countries also placed restrictions upon the country.  \n\nUnlike Austria, Germany and Hungary however, Bulgaria had a clean record of abiding by the peace demands of the Allied Powers."
 PER_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"The Nation of Iran under the leadership of King Reza is on the slow path to modernization, however many of the Major powers and even those within the country have other ideas.\n Dispite having one of the largest Oil reserves the Iranian economic situation is bleak due to unequal treaties with the British."
 DEN_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:5	"Having remained neutral through the great war, Denmark had avoided much of the death, and had gained back through a vote held in 1920, the northern part of Schleswig. \n Now on the re-elected government under Stauning, with Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre forming the government, have together with the opposition party Venstre implemented Kanslergadeforliget’s social and economical changes in 1933, which has helped Denmark out the economic crisis, but strike and lockouts over pay and worker rights are still occuring and is reaching a critical point."
