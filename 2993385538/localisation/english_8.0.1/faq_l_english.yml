 faq.1.t:0 "FAQ" #BICE Politics Notices
 faq.1.desc:0 "PLEASE READ: Because BICE changes vanilla Hearts of Iron IV in a lot of ways, there are several aspects of the mod that aren't readily apparent, yet crucial for any campaign. Researching certain categories of equipment (for example anti-tank rifles) can IMMEDIATELY lead to battalions requiring that equipment.\n\nIF YOU ARE USING ANY OTHER MODS, IT'S AT YOUR OWN RISK. It is also VERY likely that if you have any other mods than the main three, it will break BICE.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT FORGET TO MOBILIZE LEADING UP TO WAR, WAY BEFORE WAR BREAKS OUT! MOBILIZATION takes 6 WEEKS for each stage, so you need to start EARLY, and is DIFFERENT from economical mobilization, namely it's the third law from the left in the MANPOWER category of laws.\nNATO counters are HIGHLY recommended, you can change them from Game Options->Game->Use NATO symbols. You don't need to have any DLCs, but be aware that certain functions of BICE will not work if you don't have all the DLCs. For example, the Arab focus trees will not work properly if you don't have Waking the Tiger. You also need to be using vanilla 1.6.2\nIt's recommended that you keep autosaves on, otherwise you might encounter a crash and have to start over. You also have to play in English or the production interface will be full of meaningless text and the world tension display won't show the percent." #\n\nThank you for your understanding!
 #mention what seeing a picture of blondi means #mention that seeing italian social republic instead of kingdom of italy or free states instead of united states means that you are using mods that overwrite the italian country file or american country file

 faq.2.desc:0 "Q. Why do all my ministers disappear when my government changes? \n\nA: Not all ministers will work for opposing ideologies. An event will fire that removes all of your ministers and gives you 750 PP to choose from the new compatible cabinet. \n\nQ: I don't recognize _____ minister, is he ahistorical? Also, you're missing \"insert historical minister here.\" \n\nAs we only have so much time to mod and research, some things get left behind. All countries should have generic ministers to fill in slots that don't have any historical ministers. We will try to add a new batch of ministers every so often, both for starting cabinets for additional ideologies. You can speed this process up by providing us with lists of ministers you would like to see added, preferably with the traits and party identification you think they should have."

 faq.3.t:0 "Changing Your Country's Ideology"
 faq.3.desc:0 "There are several ways to change your country's government. It can happen naturally through ideological drift/events/subversion etc., it can happen through elections if support is high enough, through national focuses, and by advisors. \n\nAs many players will want to change their ideology as fast as possible, advisors are the best way to go. In your political advisor slots, there are a number of ministers who provide ideological drift for all the opposing ideologies. Pick your desired advisor and wait for the event chain to start."

Thanks and happy playing! \n\n(Will add new questions as they appear)"

 faq.5.desc:0 "Q. Why do I not get the UNIT I supposed to get by event as a player?\n\nA: You get just enough army-experience points to upgrade the UNIT's division-template inside Recruit & Deploy.\n\n So please read the description with the events. It explains what to do and which subunits you supposed to add to the division-template and/or rename the subunit mentioned in the description.\nAlso the picture shows schematic what to do and which units.\n\nFOR NOW ONLY SS-units and Grossdeutschland-unit."
