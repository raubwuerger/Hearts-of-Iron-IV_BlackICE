 bulgarians.1.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to sign the Tripartite!"
 bulgarians.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis in an effort to help us in our goal of world domination."
 bulgarians.1.a:0 "Let them in."
 bulgarians.1.b:0 "We don't want them in!"
 bulgarians.2.t:0 "We are allowed in!"
 bulgarians.2.d:0 "Germany has allowed us to join the Axis Powers and with that, we formalised our alliance and signed the Tripartite Pact."
 bulgarians.2.a:0 "Hurray!"
 bulgarians.3.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.3.d:0 "The gruesome Germans have declined our request to join the Axis!"
 bulgarians.3.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.4.t:0 "Romania a puppet?"
 bulgarians.4.d:0 "The Bulgarians have demanded that we join their ludicrous faction and country. They have threatened to go to war with us if we decline, however. It might be wise to consider it."
 bulgarians.4.a:0 "Hmpf, fine."
 bulgarians.4.b:0 "What! Never."
 bulgarians.5.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.5.d:0 "The Romanians have accepted our demands to become part of our country. Now all is left is for us to decide whether we want to incorporate our former territories back into our country or to let them keep it."
 bulgarians.5.a:0 "We shall take some"
 bulgarians.5.b:0 "Let them keep it"
 bulgarians.6.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.6.d:0 "The fools declined our grand request of them becoming part of our country! We should make them pay for this!"
 bulgarians.6.a:0 "So we shall."
 bulgarians.7.t:0 "The Drama Uprising"
 bulgarians.7.d:0 "As a response to our Bulgarisation process, the Greeks have risen up and rebelled against the country. Many valiant soldiers were lost in combat against them."
 bulgarians.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 bulgarians.8.t:0 "Declare war on Turkey?"
 bulgarians.8.d:0 "The Bulgarians have suggested that we officially go to war with Turkey in order to remove from their presence from the Balkans. The Balkans are to be Balkan only, in their view, and the Turks no longer have a place there."
 bulgarians.8.a:0 "They're right!"
 bulgarians.8.b:0 "Let's not."
 bulgarians.9.t:0 "Treaty with Bulgaria"
 bulgarians.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we support them in modernisation, and request that we aid them in researching planes for the Bulgarian airforce. This might drive them closer to us, and might be worth it in the long run."
 bulgarians.9.a:0 "What's the harm?"
 bulgarians.9.b:0 "What?! No! Our experience is our own."
 bulgarians.10.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgarians.10.d:0 "The Italians agreed to help with our modernisation!"
 bulgarians.10.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.11.t:0 "They didn't agree!"
 bulgarians.11.d:0 "The Italians didn't agree to our research treaty! Eventually we shall teach them."
 bulgarians.11.a:0 "Bah, filth."
 bulgarians.12.t:0 "Bulgaria to join the Comintern?"
 bulgarians.12.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested to join the Comintern. They are a socialist state now and it might be beneficial to add them to our alliance."
 bulgarians.12.a:0 "Very well"
 bulgarians.12.b:0 "They are alone"
 bulgarians.13.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.13.d:0 "We have been accepted into the Comintern. Together, the Communist Brotherhood stands strong!"
 bulgarians.13.a:0 "Finally!"
 bulgarians.14.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.14.d:0 "We have been declined membership to the Comintern. This only makes them a target of Greater Bulgaria."
 bulgarians.14.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 bulgarians.15.t:0 "The Balkan Federation"
 bulgarians.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered that we join a faction with them based on our shared ideologies. It might be good, as this would prove that the Balkans can actually be united."
 bulgarians.15.a:0 "Seems fair."
 bulgarians.15.b:0 "I think not."
 bulgarians.16.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgarians.16.d:0 "Yugoslavia has agreed to our concept of a united Balkans. A Communist community in the Balkans is a great idea anyway, and anyone who says otherwise is foolish."
 bulgarians.16.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.17.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgarians.17.d:0 "The Yugoslavians declined our idea for a united Balkans! The fools! We should show them!"
 bulgarians.17.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.18.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Thrace!"
 bulgarians.18.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their old territory of Thrace. While they formerly owned it after the First Balkan War, Thrace is now obviously Greek! However, appeasement might be a good call."
 bulgarians.18.a:0 "Give it up."
 bulgarians.18.b:0 "Thrace is Greek!"
 bulgarians.19.t:0 "Greece Accepted!"
 bulgarians.19.d:0 "The Greeks have accepted our demands for Thrace. They must realise that they are an inferior power compared to us."
 bulgarians.19.a:0 "Good."
 bulgarians.20.t:0 "The Greeks Declined!"
 bulgarians.20.d:0 "The Greeks have declined our demands for territory! We should show them who has the real power here!"
 bulgarians.20.a:0 "Indeed we should."
 bulgarians.21.t:0 "Re-affirm the Entente!"
 bulgarians.21.d:0 "Per request from Bulgaria, it has been suggested that we reform the Balkan Entente, not only to include them, but also to sign several new treaties between the member states and to ensure supportive relations."
 bulgarians.21.a:0 "We agree."
 bulgarians.21.b:0 "We don't need anyone."
 bulgarians.22.t:0 "Invitation to the Entente"
 bulgarians.22.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we reform the Balkan Entente with them included. They made this request to Yugoslavia, and they seemingly agreed to this request, so either way they will form it. Now the question is if we want to join as well."
 bulgarians.22.a:0 "Sure, why not."
 bulgarians.22.b:0 "Let's not."
 bulgarians.23.t:0 "Yugoslavia said no!"
 bulgarians.23.d:0 "Yugoslavia has said no to our request to reform the Balkan Entente. Now I suppose this means they are no longer allied either, but we are not in an alliance with any of them either."
 bulgarians.23.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.24.t:0 "Macedonian Uprising!"
 bulgarians.24.a:0 "Disaster!"
 bulgarians.24.d:0 "The Macedonians have risen up against us! Our way of dealing with them was less effective than hoped, and now they have risen up against us. We dealt with them, but it costed us manpower that's not easily replaced. However, we made sure it would not happen again."
 bulgarians.25.t:0 "An agreement proposed!"
 bulgarians.25.d:0 "The Bulgarians have proposed an agreement. Since the Bulgarians have a clean record of adhering to the effects of the peace treaty of the Great War. They may have redeemed themselves, and they might be a usefull ally. They already have the support of both Britian and the other Balkan Entente members and now just need our approval. Allowing them this concession would surely improve our standing globally. Refusing would likely isolate us."
 bulgarians.25.a:0 "Alright, fine."
 bulgarians.25.b:0 "What, no!"
 bulgarians.26.t:0 "Greece agreed!"
 bulgarians.26.d:0 "Good news! The Greeks have agreed to lift the restrictions placed upon our country. We can now finally start preparing our country for the upcoming conflict."
 bulgarians.26.a:0 "Victory!"
 bulgarians.27.t:0 "The Greeks disagreed!"
 bulgarians.27.d:0 "The obviously disillusioned government of Greece has disagreed to our rearmament! We must act on this! If we are to prepare our country, then we shall have to stop abiding by the peace treaty."
 bulgarians.27.a:0 "Then so we shall."
 bulgarians.28.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Dobrudja"
 bulgarians.28.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their former territory of Dobrudja. They formerly owned this territory after the First Balkan War, but gradually lost it when the Second Balkan War kicked off. It might be wise to appease them, although if we could destroy them before they become a threat, that would be good."
 bulgarians.28.a:0 "Give it back"
 bulgarians.28.b:0 "No, it's ours!"
 bulgarians.29.t:0 "Romania agrees!"
 bulgarians.29.d:0 "Romania has agreed to give us back Dobrudja, the territory we lost after the events of the Great War. We should use this opportunity."
 bulgarians.29.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarians.30.t:0 "Romania declined!"
 bulgarians.30.d:0 "The Romanians have declined our demand for Dobrudja! We should teach them not to oppose us!"
 bulgarians.30.a:0 "Damnation!"

 bulgarian_news.1.t:0 "The Bulgarians signed the Tripartite Pact!"
 bulgarian_news.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has signed the Tripartite Pact and with that formalised their allegiance to Germany, and are an Axis member."
 bulgarian_news.1.a:0 "Well then"
 bulgarian_news.1.b:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarian_news.1.c:0 "A toast to the Bulgarians!"
 bulgarian_news.2.t:0 "Bulgaria joins the Comintern!"
 bulgarian_news.2.d:0 "Bulgaria has joined the Comintern and decided to reinforce their Slavic brothers in the potential conflicts to come."
 bulgarian_news.2.a:0 "Fair enough."
 bulgarian_news.2.b:0 "Woohoo!"
 bulgarian_news.2.c:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
 bulgarian_news.4.t:0 "Tsar Boris III dies!"
 bulgarian_news.4.d:0 "Tsar Boris the Third of Bulgaria has tragically died from heart failure today. Formally, Simeon II, Boris' son, would take over the tsardom, but being not of age, Boris' brother, Prince Kiril of Preslav, took over command of the country."
 bulgarian_news.4.a:0 "Oh well"
 bulgarian_news.5.t:0 "Tsar Boris survives alleged assassination"
 bulgarian_news.5.d:0 "According to the Bulgarian news papers, Tsar Boris had survived an attempt of assassination, allegedly planned by Germany to dispose of the tsar."
 bulgarian_news.5.a:0 "Allegedly? Hm.."
 bulgarian_news.6.t:0 "Restrictions upon Bulgaria lifted!"
 bulgarian_news.6.d:0 "The Greek government has agreed to the rearmament of the Bulgarian military. After the Great War, Bulgaria has been limited in its military efforts and production. Bulgaria has a record of abiding to them however, which convinced the Greeks that the effects should be lifted."
 bulgarian_news.6.a:0 "If they deem it wise.."
 bulgarian_news.6.b:0 "... Yeah, thanks.."

 bulgariansenhanced.1.t:0 "Bulgaria requests German arms!"
 bulgariansenhanced.1.d:0 "Bulgaria, in their effort to rearm themselves, has requested our support. The Bulgarians say that the British have allowed them to rearm freely, citing the instability in the region as their reasoning. Now the Bulgarians request that we send them a few thousand guns to help them in rearming. Agreeing would develop our relations with the Bulgarians but they could just as easily stab us in the back and side with the enemy, we should carefully consider our options."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.a:0 "Very well, help them."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.t:0 "The Germans agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.2.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to our request for aid in rearming. We have been given two-thousand guns to help us along. Obviously, we should compensate them! Or we could use the guns and never look at them again, it's a lottery."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.a:0 ".. Yeah."
 bulgariansenhanced.3.t:0 "The Germans declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.d:0 "The Germans have declined our most generous request for supplies! We only requested two-thousand guns, and they can definitely spare the guns. Damn them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.a:0 "What! Filth!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.t:0 "Bulgarian Friendship?"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.d:0 "Bulgaria has suggested that we sign a Treaty of friendship with them, to be labeled the Treaty of Eternal Friendship. The Bulgarians want to improve relations with us, now this is obviously a trap, but going along with it might actually be fruitful for us."
 bulgariansenhanced.4.a:0 "Sign it!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.b:0 "How about.. no."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.5.d:0 "The Yugoslavs agreed to our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! I figure they realise that we actually are their friends! Well, they think we are, but we know better."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.d:0 "The Yugoslavs have declined our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! How could they?! Do they not realise that we've changed? The fools! We should teach them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.a:0 "How unfortunate."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.t:0 "Georgi Kyoseivanov resigns!"
 bulgariansenhanced.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister resigns! Prime minister Kyoseivanov, who has led the country since 1935, has officially resigned from service! Now we could install a successor, which would be Bogdan Filov, an ally of Tsar Boris himself! Or we could dissolve Kyoseivanov's government entirely and install Boris III as our leader, considering, he is. We'd be installing a government handpicked by Boris himself."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.a:0 "Filov it is."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.b:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.t:0 "Fatherland Front empowered!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.d:0 "Our attempt to empower the Fatherland Front has paid off! The Fatherland Front just became the majority party of the government and they've officially taken control. Tsar Boris is still in power but no longer in direct control. Now to hope that the Fatherland Front can steer us away from Germany's side and on the Soviet side."
 bulgariansenhanced.8.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.t:0 "Entry to the Balkan Pact?"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested entry to the Balkan Entente as an affiliate state. This means we'll guarantee them our aid if anyone goes to war with Bulgaria. Naturally, when someone does go to war with them, we can just abandon them, although this'll cost us our reputation. Of course we can also decide not to guarantee them and we'll be off fine."
 bulgariansenhanced.9.a:0 "Welcome them in!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.t:0 "They said no!"
 bulgariansenhanced.10.d:0 "Those bloody Romanians rejected our request! We're not allowed into the Balkan Entente! This is maddening! We should take revenge, and shoot them, or something. They can't be allowed to do this."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.a:0 "What!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.t:0 "Bulgarians wish to negotiate!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.d:0 "It seems the Bulgarian government has finally realised that they're on the losing side of this war, rather late, might I add. We will obviously be compensated for this. That aside, it's now time for us to decide their fate. Either they'll become our ally against the Germans and join the Comintern, or we'll leave them to be crushed by the Soviet might."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.a:0 "Yeah alright."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.b:0 "Kill!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.d:0 "The Soviet have agreed to let us into the Comintern! Now we'll be fighting on the good side, and we might gain something out of this too! But now, we should focus on the fighting with Nazi Germany, and make the Soviets proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.12.a:0 "Mila Rodino Bulgaria!"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.t:0 "The Soviets declined"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.d:0 "The Soviets have declined our offer! Our attempt at survival with the Soviets has failed. Now we should do all we can to survive on the side of the Germans. We should make them proud, but more importantly, make our country and our people proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.13.a:0 "Damnation!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to re-affirm the Balkan Entente!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.d:0 "The current system that is the Balkan Entente seems to have fallen out of practise. Our allies will not help us in a war unless we bind them by treaty. Maybe this is actually a good idea. On the other hand, if we want to step away from the Balkans, we should probably not re-affirm it."
 bulgariansenhanced.14.a:0 "Found it! Send out the invites!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.b:0 "Nah."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.15.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to re-affirming the Balkan Entente. We've been invited as an honoured member, and should Romania prove incapable of leading the alliance any further, that role should fall to us. With that said, the other members of the Balkan Entente have also been invited to re-affirm the Balkan Entente. They probably realise that the current system is really broken anyway, so we'll be good."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.a:0 "Oh hey!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.t:0 "The Romanians hate us!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.d:0 "Okay maybe too dramatic, they probably don't hate us. However, they will not re-affirm the Balkan Entente. It is probably safe to assume that they're looking to lash out on their own. Or they do truly hate us and the other members of the Balkan Entente. One or the other. Either way, now there are two of them."
 bulgariansenhanced.16.a:0 "Two of them? What?"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.t:0 "The Albanian Inheritance"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.d:0 "The Bulgarians have demanded that we become their puppet, citing that our territory was supposedly the territory of one of their former empires. Naturally, we don't remember any of this. However, the Bulgarians outsize us by far, and there's only a slim chance that we'll be able to defeat them if they come invading us. It might be feasible to become their puppet and gain our independence back, although if you're faithful, by all means, go ahead and decline."
 bulgariansenhanced.17.a:0 "Yeah alright let's go"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.b:0 "I'm faithful!"
 bulgariansenhanced.18.t:0 "They agreed."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.d:0 "The Albanians realised that we're right, and they have accepted us as their legitimate overlords. Now, we should peacefully integrate Albania into Greater Bulgaria. They are just one step towards making our nation great again."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.a:0 "Bam."
 bulgariansenhanced.19.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.d:0 "The foolish Albanians have declined our request to become our puppet! Do they not realise that their territory is ours by right? What's wrong with them?! We should seize their territory with immediate effect! They disrespect the greater Bulgarian Empire!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.a:0 "Attack!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to our request of partnership with the Balkan Entente. If somebody goes to war with us now, the Romanians should come to our aid, hopefully. Now we should evolve this into a functional alliance, between us, Romania, and the other members of the Balkan Entente."
 bulgariansenhanced.20.a:0 "Woo!"
