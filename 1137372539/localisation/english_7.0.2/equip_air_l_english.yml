 #### Engine Tiers ####
 tech_air_engine_early:0 "Early Aircraft Engine"
 tech_air_engine_early_desc:0 "The technology to produce more powerful aircraft engines is essential to developing more capable aircraft."
 tech_air_engine_improved:0 "Improved Aircraft Engine"
 tech_air_engine_improved_desc:0 "Further advances in engine design and engineering mean we can develop more powerful engines for a new generation of aircraft."
 tech_air_engine_advanced:0 "Advanced Aircraft Engine"
 tech_air_engine_advanced_desc:0 "In order to produce more advanced aircraft, we need to develop more powerful engines for them."
 tech_air_engine_semimodern:0 "Late Aircraft Engine"
 tech_air_engine_semimodern_desc:0 "Our aircraft need an even more powerful engine. We must push the capabilities of piston engine design to their limits."
 tech_air_engine_jet:0 "Jet Engine"
 tech_air_engine_jet_desc:0 "The first practical jet engines are within our grasp. While they are expensive and not all that reliable, even now the potential performance is extremely impressive."
 tech_air_engine_jet_improved:0 "Improved Jet Engine"
 tech_air_engine_jet_improved_desc:0 "A series of improvements to early jet engines, increasing both their power and reliability."
 tech_air_engine_motorjet:0 "Motorjet Engine"
 tech_air_engine_motorjet_desc:0 "Secondo Campini has been developing what he calls a thermojet for several years. This method of propulsion could lead to high performance aircraft that do not need the same level of advanced materials and construction as traditional jet engines."
