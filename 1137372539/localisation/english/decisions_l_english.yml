It was intended to take on the roles of army-level reconnaissance and security that had traditionally been the responsibility of cavalry. It included mechanized recon units, motorized infantry, and a battalion of tanks. The concept of the Leichte Brigade, of which three were planned by the Wehrmacht, quickly showed its flawed nature and was abandoned.\nIn November 1938 the brigade was enlarged to become the §Y1. Leichte Division§!, receiving the §Y11. Panzer-regiment§! as an attachment for its participation in the occupation of the Sudetenland in October 1938 and the subsequent disestablishment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Following the latter the division received 130 Czech-built tanks which were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II the division had been equipped with.

It was created to consolidate the many small prisons that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later prisons. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the prisons under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the \"Death's Head Units\", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major prison. Leadership at the prisons was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional prisons. Six prisons housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939.

Codreanu gave a speech, stating that within a week of taking over, Romania would be allied with Germany, implicitly disregarding the King's authority to set foreign policy. Perhaps such declarations should be reworded, to offer an olive branch to the King."

 IRE_army_organisation_desc:0 "The Defence Forces of Ireland in 1936 was in a sorry state. Demobilised since the Civil War of 1922-23 and purposefully reduced since the failed Army Mutiny of 1924, the Army is no more than a couple front-line battalions, with several more territorial second-rate battalions in reserve. The Army is organised into four commands: the East, South, West and Curragh Commands, all of which are responsible for the defence of their assigned areas. The Curragh Command is comprised of the more advanced arms of the Army, including the mechanised Cavalry Corps and the Anti-Air Artillery. With only one squadron of bi-planes, the Aer Corps remains criminally under-funded and under-equipped like its ground counterpart, all the while no sort of Navy exists to protect the shores of the State."
