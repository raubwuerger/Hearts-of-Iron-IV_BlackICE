 tfv_australia.1.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Proposal about the Singapore Strategy"
 tfv_australia.1.d:0 "The Singapore Strategy has been the cornerstone of our deterrence policy against [JAP.GetNameDef] since the end of the Great War. However, the redeployment of the Main Fleet to Singapore in case of attack is reliant on support from our allies in [From.GetNameDef]. With the potential threat against British holdings in the Far East increasing by the day, the [From.GetAdjective] high command has presented a potential new stratagem, that would see Australia in far greater control of the defense of the region.\n\nIt's a sound plan, and the only question is whether we believe they can provide the security we require."
 tfv_australia.1.a:1 "Australia should provide the first line of defense in Southeast Asia."
 tfv_australia.1.b:0 "The Singapore Strategy will remain as it always has."
 tfv_australia.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Transfers Colonial Holdings"
 tfv_australia.2.d:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] has passed the law that will transfer control of all [From.GetAdjective] colonial possessions near Singapore and Borneo to [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nOur national safety is finally in our own hands."
 tfv_australia.2.a:0 "We will not disappoint."
tfv_australia.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers Protection for Our Colonies"
 tfv_australia.10.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has initiated negotiations with [Root.GetAdjective] diplomats for the potential transfer of responsibility over the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia.\n\nConsidering the challenges inherent in defending said territory, a partnership may not be such a bad idea. It would mean that for the foreseeable future said territory would only be nominally [Root.GetAdjective], but nominal ownership is surely better than completely losing them."
 tfv_australia.10.a:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] will be the executor of [Root.GetAdjective] interests in the region."
 tfv_australia.10.b:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] territory will remain in [Root.GetAdjective] hands!"

 tfv_australia.11.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] troops stood ready to assume responsibilities for the protection of all [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia as soon as [From.GetLeader] approved the agreement.\n\nWhile some local resistance was met in the transfer, fear of foreign aggression ensures that most recognize the need for [Root.GetAdjective] defense."
 tfv_australia.11.a:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] will do what she must."
 tfv_australia.12.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Block Regional Safety Measures"
 tfv_australia.12.d:0 "Believing themselves to be sufficiently capable of protecting [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our proposal of a shared defense strategy.\n\nUndoubtedly motivated by worries of colonial control, their actions are understandable. However, if they are incapable of protecting their territory - as we fear - we may see it used as the launch platform for an attack on the Australian continent."
 tfv_australia.12.a:0 "We can only hope they will be able to resist."
 
 tfv_australia.70.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Right to Control Protectorates"
 tfv_australia.70.d:0 "Claiming that a failure on the part of [Root.GetNameDef] to defend its colonial holdings in Southeast Asia would have catastrophic implications for [From.GetNameDef] national defense, [From.GetLeader] has requested that the [From.GetAdjective] government be given full, independent responsibility for the defense of the region.\nWhile not an outright demand, the growth of [From.GetAdjective] strategic and military influence in the region has the argument make some sense. The counterbalance being the recent political distancing from us that [From.GetNameDef] has embraced.\nThis would be an agreement with a potential partner, not a subject, and would leave the colonies de facto out of our hands, should [From.GetNameDef] choose to make it so."
 tfv_australia.70.a:0 "Yes, the stability of Southeast Asia is a priority."
 tfv_australia.70.b:0 "No, we will be the sole controller of our own colonial possessions!"
 tfv_australia.71.t:0 "Defensive Commission"
 tfv_australia.71.d:0 "Following overtures from the [Root.GetAdjective] military command, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to give us \"intermediate control\" of all [From.GetAdjective] colonial holdings in Southeast Asia.\n\nWith the old forces of the Pacific none the wiser, our attempts to ensure [Root.GetNameDef] dominance over the region continues."
 tfv_australia.71.a:0 "We'll make the old country proud."
 tfv_australia.72.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines \"Defense Project\""
 tfv_australia.72.d:0 "Despite overtures from the [Root.GetAdjective] High Command, [From.GetNameDef] has rejected our request for control of their colonies in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nOur ambitions are untempered, however. We will continue to seek ways of securing [Root.GetAdjective] prominence in the Pacific."

Following several weeks of lunches, dinners, garden parties, receptions, and more dinners, he has finally succeeded in securing a private audience with the new King. \n\nAfter an exchange of pleasantries and small talk, the topic turns to politics. The King goes on a lengthy tirade about Commonwealth solidarity and loyalty to the mother country, and as he goes to address continental politics [AST.GetLeader] cannot help but feel a little uncomfortable.

 ast.1.t:0 "Expand Conscription to unmarried men?"
 ast.1.desc:0 "A bill has been proposed for the conscription of unmarried men into the CMF. Historically in 1939, conscription was introduced for unmarried men aged 21, unlucky to be that age in 1939, these men would train for three months in the CMF and would only serve in Australia or Australian territory such as Papua New Guinea. The issue of conscription wasn't a divided issue as it was in the Great War, so policies such as this one did not cause extensive controversy."
 ast.1.a:0 "Every man shall do his duty" tfv_australia.1.desc:0 "With our ally France surrendering, we must take more serious attitudes towards the war, let us stand united against the enemy! Historically Australia struggled to gain substantial amounts of volunteers in '39, however the Fall of France shocked the Australian government and populace and surges in enlistments occured, just 48,496 in June 1940."
 tfv_australia.3.t:0 "Aboriginals in the Army"
 tfv_australia.3.desc:0 "We must decide whether to allow aboriginal and other ethnic minorities to be allowed to volunteer into the army and be applicable for conscription if the nation has it. In 1939 aboriginals weren't actually excluded from the Australian Armed Forces, perhaps due to the low numbers initially, however in 1940 the Defence Committee of Australia decided to exclude aboriginal enlistment due to it being 'neither necessary not desirable'. Aboriginals were not seen in large numbers in the AIF until the Japanese entry into the war where aboriginal exclusion was lessened. Many European Australians were fervently against aboriginal inclusion into the Australian Armed Forces due to the possibility that they would guide Japanese troops through Papua New Guinea and Australia and other assistance for personal gain."

 tfv_south_africa.5.d:0 "The Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg concluded today after four months of festivities. Including five hundred exhibitors from eighteen different commonwealth nations and nearly two million visitors, the exhibition was the first to be held in the newly formed Union of South Africa. The event promoted the sale and import of imperial goods and services across the world. Recently constructed contemporary buildings and electric infrastructure showcased the outstanding features of modern South Africa. The finish line of the Schlesinger African Air race was also observed in conjunction with the exhibition. The race, which only included imperial pilots and machines, showcased the ever increasingly strong potential of aviation over long distances with a route of 6,150 miles.\n“There is an atmosphere of prosperity about Johannesburg at present. You can sense it as you walk the streets of the Golden City. The city is on the crest of a prosperity wave. You can discern it in the high horse-power cars that travel the roads. You can see it in the well-filled restaurants and places of amusement, but most of all it is revealed in the intense building activity which is proceeding in all parts of the city.” wrote John McLean in African Affairs"

With refugees pouring in from the war stricken regions of the country, demand for food is growing every day while supply is falling short. \n\nFood prices have risen dramatically, leading to people staying away from work that no longer pays enough to feed their families. Recruitment numbers for the army have also dropped considerably as more and more people refuse to leave their homes to fight for a government that does nothing to help them."
