It was proposed that a Ka-Tsu armed with a pair of torpedoes be dropped off by submarine away from the atoll, propel itself to the outer reef using its tracks, and then enter the lagoon on the inside of the reef."

The design was all metal, except for the flight control surfaces, which were plywood. The wings used a multi-cell cantilever design.

In consequence a civil version was developed and this, generally similar to the Ki-21-I and retaining its powerplant of two 708 kW (950 hp) Nakajima Ha-5 KAI radial engines, differed primarily by having the same wings transferred from a mid to low-wing configuration and the incorporation of a new fuselage to provide accommodation for up to 11 passengers.

Their performance was a great improvement over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated Special Type destroyers. The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action, and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies."
 JAP_destroyer_8:0 "Akatsuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_8_desc:0 "The Akatsuki vessels had larger boilers and a narrower fore funnel than the previous Fubukis, and internally the number of boilers was reduced from four to three due to improvements in boiler design and efficiency. Other improvements over the Fubuki class included a splinter-proof torpedo launcher-turret, which allowed the torpedo launcher tubes to be reloaded in action."

They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use."

As with the Hatsuharu class, the Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections. Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.

 JAP_destroyer_12_desc:0 "The Kagerō class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding Asashio class. At the time of introduction, these destroyers were among the most deadly destroyers afloat, primarily due to the excellent range and lethality of its \"Long Lance\" torpedo. Only the lack of radar hindered their otherwise superb design. As with most pre-World War II ships, Kagerōs were also deficient in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weaponry as designed."

 JAP_destroyer_17_desc:0 "The Matsu class were built late in World War II, and they were intended to be more cost-effective in response to the changing character of naval warfare at that time. These ships were lighter and smaller than previous Japanese destroyers, with different armament such as enhanced anti-aircraft guns and anti-submarine weapons, and radar. Since surface warfare was believed to be less likely at this stage of the war, armament such as torpedo tubes that would be useful against surface ships was reduced."

The Agano class was unique among Japanese cruisers in that its main armament could elevate to 55 degrees, but this was still not enough to make them effective as anti-aircraft weapons."

Up to 40 torpedo launchers fitted with the deadly long lance torpeod were installed and the cruisers originial main armament was removed for that.

After Japan refused to comply any longer with that agreement, all four ships were rearmed in 1939 with larger guns and were reclassified as heavy cruisers, the so called Heavy Mogami class.

Although the United States Navy planned to arm its Colorado class with 16-inch (406 mm) guns before the Nagato class was designed, Nagato's 410-millimeter (16.1 in) guns made her the first dreadnought that was launched armed with guns larger than 15 inches (381 mm).

 JAP_coastal_submarine_1:0 "Malyutka Class (Series VI)"
 JAP_coastal_submarine_1_desc:0 "The M-class submarines, also Malyutka-class (Russian: Малютка; baby or little one), were a class of small, single-, or 1½-hulled coastal submarines built in the Soviet Union and used during World War II. Submarines of this class were in four series: VI, VI-bis, XII, XV, each with minor improvements compared to the previous class. Although the design was satisfactory, only limited results were obtained and losses were heavy with 33 submarines sunk between 1941 and 1945. The sub-classes featured a moderate speed roughly 13 knots surfaced and 7-8 knots submerged and had a main armament of two 533mm torpedo tubes."

 JAP_coastal_submarine_5:0 "Project 615 (Quebec) Class"
 JAP_coastal_submarine_5_desc:0 "This submarine class was developed shortly after world war II to further increase the soviet unions capabilities in coastal defence. The project 615 was bigger than the previous M-class submarines, displacing roughly 550 long tons and featuring a good top speed of 18 knots surfaced and 16 knots submerged incoperated many improvements of the previous M-class submarines. The main armament consisted of four 533mm torpedo tubes and moderate anti-aircraft guns."
