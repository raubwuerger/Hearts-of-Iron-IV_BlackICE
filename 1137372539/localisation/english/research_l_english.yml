In the Type VIIC/41, the crush depth was increased from 200m to 250m.\nIn order to increase the crush depth, all non-essential equipment were removed and many others were replaced with newer, lighter material. The weight savings was used to increase hull thickness from 0.73in (18.5mm) to 0.83in (21mm), which increased the crush depth to 820ft (250m)."
 tech_patrol_sub_hulldesign4:0 "Hull Design IV SS"
 tech_patrol_sub_hulldesign4_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/42 was a planned further improvement of the VIIC/41. A contract was placed for 165 of this new boat, but none were ever laid, let alone completed.\nThis design would have housed an additional supercharger, increasing engine efficiency and surface range to 10,000nm. Surface speed would have increased by 1.6 knots to 18.6kt. The pressure hull was both lengthened, and increased in diameter to house additional equipment. However the most significant improvement of this design was for the material of the hull to be fabricated by armored quality steel. With the planned increase in thickness to 1.1in (28mm), the crush depth of this boat would have been an astonishing 1,640ft (500m)."

 tech_panzer_i_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1933 the German military issued a requirement for a light armored vehicle that could be used for training. Krupp's design won, and it was designated as a "industrial tractor" to conceal its true purpose. Production began in 1934. Originally intended to serve as a training vehicle, the Panzer I was lightly armored and armed only with a machine gun. However, it was used in frontline divisions in the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France due to the shortage of better tanks. By the end of 1941, it had been phased out of service, although the command model remained in service longer. Its chassis continued to be used in other roles, such as carrying ammunition, or as a self-propelled anti-tank gun."
 tech_panzer_ii_equipment_1:0 "Panzer II A/B"
 tech_panzer_ii_equipment_1_desc:0 "In order to bridge the gap before the arrival of the Panzer III and IV, German military leadership ordered a stopgap vehicle in 1934. After trials the MAN model succeeded and would be known as the Panzer II. Lightly armored and armed only with machine guns and a 20mm autocannon, it was more suited for training and reconnaissance duties than frontline combat. However, it formed the backbone of the German armored divisions in the Battle of France, with about 1,000 in frontline service. The Panzer II would continue to serve in North Africa and the Soviet Union until enough better tanks were available.\nThe Panzer II Ausf A was the first production model, delivered in 1935. Early tests showed that its engine was underpowered, and the Ausf B variant recieved a more powerful one and thicker frontal armor."

The latter would eventually become the Panzer IV. Its job was to fight anti-tank gun positions and fortifications, and for this it would be equipped with a low velocity gun designed mainly to fire HE shells. Krupp took over total responsibility of the vehicle and production started in 1936. The Ausf A variant was soon replaced by the Ausf B, which had a more powerful engine, better transmission, a commander's cupola, and more armor. The Ausf C variant introduced more armor.\nThe Panzer IV had the distinction of remaining in production throughout the entire war, and was well known as the "workhorse" of German armored divisions."

 tech_panzer_iv_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Ausf D variant of the Panzer IV was introduced in 1939 and recieved increased armor on its sides and turret.

Production of the Ausf E version, with even more armor and an improved commander's cupola, began in 1940."

In 1935, the Czech army began trials of a new medium tank. The S-11 (or T-11) was initially plagued with problems resulting from its rushed development, but these were gradually overcome and the vehicle gained a good reputation. After the occupation of Czechslovakia, the Germans captured these vehicles and designated them as the Panzer 35(t). Due to the shortage of better tanks in the early war, it was used in frontline units up until 1942, when most were converted into armored tractors. A unique feature of the Panzer 35(t) was that its transmission and steering were assisted by compressed air to reduce driver fatigue, allowing it to travel long distances."

An opportunity to test this concept came about in 1940 after the Panzer I was phased out of frontline combat. A 37mm Pak gun, eventually replaced by a hard-hitting Czech 47mm gun, was mounted on a turretless Panzer I chassis and named the Panzerjager I. The result was promising, if a little crude. The Panzerjager I served in North Africa and the Eastern Front. It was capable of defeating opposing tanks, but lacked protection for the crew. It was used up until 1945."

 ### Surface Fleet RADAR tech
 ijn_surface_search_radar:0 "Surface Search Radar"
 ijn_surface_search_radar_desc:0 "The early radar sets were bulky, and required a lot of power, so were only practically able to be installed on larger vessels.  They proved valuable in aiding ships' tactical awareness, particularly in low visibility situations."
 ijn_air_warning_radar:0 "Air Warning Radar"
 ijn_air_warning_radar_desc:0 "As radar sets were refined, they were employed to provide early warning of air attack. In effect, this enabled vessels to be ready for the aircraft and put up a stronger air defence."

 ### Surface Fleet ASW tech
 ijn_early_sonar:0 "Early Sonar"
 ijn_early_sonar_desc:0 "Developed at the end of the first-world war, and initially known as ASDIC, sonar was thought at the time to have likely rendered submarines ineffective in future wars.  While this was a drastic overestimate of sonar's capabilities, these early sets were still useful in enabling surface vessels to combat submerged enemies."
 ijn_depth_charge_throwers:0 "Depth Charge Throwers"
 ijn_depth_charge_throwers_desc:0 "The main weapon against submarines in the inter-war period and for most of the Second World War was the depth charge.  Depth charges could be rolled off the stern of a ship onto the expected location of a sub, but the development of depth charge throwers enabled vessels to project patterns of depth charges over a wider area, increasing their effectiveness."
 ijn_basic_sonar:0 "Basic Sonar"
 ijn_basic_sonar_desc:0 "Using sound to detect vessels underwater was (and is) a complex science, and sonar systems advanced on numerous occasions between the end of the First and the Second World Wars"
 ijn_asw_mortars:0 "Anti-Submarine Mortars"
 ijn_asw_mortars_desc:0 "A key shortcoming of sonar was that contact was lost when the attacking ship travelled over the target, giving the submarine a window within which it could maneuver to evade the coming depth charge attack.  The invention of anti-submarine mortars such as Hedgehog and Mousetrap allowed escorts to fire at targets in front of them, and were an important addition to anti-submarine warfare."
 ijn_advanced_sonar:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 ijn_advanced_sonar_desc:0 "Representing the most advanced sonar developed during the period, these sets are better at finding submerged raiders, and are important to counter ever-improving submarine design."

 late_war_AA_tech_rn_desc:0 "Improved fire control and powered training and elevation, combined with innovations including ammunition with proximity fuses, greatly improved the effectiveness of naval AA systems."
 surface_search_radar_rn:0 "Surface Search Radar"
 surface_search_radar_rn_desc:0 "The early radar sets were bulky, and required a lot of power, so were only practically able to be installed on larger vessels.  They proved valuable in aiding ships' tactical awareness, particularly in low visibility situations."
 air_warning_radar_rn:0 "Air Warning Radar"
 air_warning_radar_rn_desc:0 "As radar sets were refined, they were employed to provide early warning of air attack. In effect, this enabled vessels to be ready for the aircraft and put up a stronger air defence."
 advanced_surface_search_rn_radar:0 "Advanced Surface Search Radar"
 advanced_surface_search_rn_radar_desc:0 "The development of centimetric radar allowed the installation of far more powerful but also far smaller radar sets.  This meant larger vessels had even more tactical awareness, and smaller vessels were able to employ radar as well."
 surface_fc_radar_rn:0 "Surface Fire Control Radar"
 surface_fc_radar_rn_desc:0 "It wasn't long before radar was being used to assist with fire control and ranging, making larger warships more effective at range and at night."
 advanced_fc_rn_radar:0 "Anti-Air Fire Control Radar"
 advanced_fc_radar_rn_desc:0 "Further improvements in radar led to them aiding in target acquisition for ships' anti-aircraft weapons, enabling significantly more accurate AA fire against incoming aircraft."
 early_sonar_rn:0 "Early Sonar"
 early_sonar_rn_desc:0 "Developed at the end of the first-world war, and initially known as ASDIC, sonar was thought at the time to have likely rendered submarines ineffective in future wars.  While this was a drastic overestimate of sonar's capabilities, these early sets were still useful in enabling surface vessels to combat submerged enemies."
 depth_charge_throwers_rn:0 "Depth Charge Throwers"
 depth_charge_throwers_rn_desc:0 "The main weapon against submarines in the inter-war period and for most of the Second World War was the depth charge.  Depth charges could be rolled off the stern of a ship onto the expected location of a sub, but the development of depth charge throwers enabled vessels to project patterns of depth charges over a wider area, increasing their effectiveness."
 basic_sonar_rn:0 "Basic Sonar"
 basic_sonar_rn_desc:0 "Using sound to detect vessels underwater was (and is) a complex science, and sonar systems advanced on numerous occasions between the end of the First and the Second World Wars"
 asw_mortars_rn:0 "Anti-Submarine Mortars"
 asw_mortars_rn_desc:0 "A key shortcoming of sonar was that contact was lost when the attacking ship travelled over the target, giving the submarine a window within which it could maneuver to evade the coming depth charge attack.  The invention of anti-submarine mortars such as Hedgehog and Mousetrap allowed escorts to fire at targets in front of them, and were an important addition to anti-submarine warfare."
 advanced_sonar_rn:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 advanced_sonar_rn_desc:0 "Representing the most advanced sonar developed during the period, these sets are better at finding submerged raiders, and are important to counter ever-improving submarine design."
 sub_rn_interwar_AA_tech:0 "Interwar AA"
 sub_rn_interwar_AA_tech_desc:0 "While navies had started adding anti-aircraft guns to their ships before the end of the First World War, many navies expanded their investments in naval AA during the 1920s, developing medium-calibre, rapid-firing weapons designed primarily to engage aircraft."
 sub_rn_late_1930s_AA_tech:0 "Pre-war AA"
 sub_rn_late_1930s_AA_tech_desc:0 "As aircraft continued to develop, navies in turn refined their AA systems (although the outbreak of war would see that they were insufficient to the task), with higher-velocity, multi-barreled systems, and early anti-air fire control systems."
 sub_rn_early_war_AA_tech:0 "Wartime AA expansion"
 sub_rn_early_war_AA_tech_desc:0 "Wartime experience highlighted the need for greater AA installations on existing and new vessels to counter the threat posed by aircraft."
 sub_rn_late_war_AA_tech:0 "Advanced AA systems"
 sub_rn_late_war_AA_tech_desc:0 "Improved fire control and powered training and elevation, combined with innovations including ammunition with proximity fuses, greatly improved the effectiveness of naval AA systems."
 sub_rn_interwar_torpedoes:0 "Interwar Torpedoes"
 sub_rn_interwar_torpedoes_desc:0 "Torpedoes continued to develop after the first world war, and most of the major nations in WW2 used torpedoes designed and first put into service in the 1920s and early 1930s.\nFor the UK they developed the 18inch and the 21inch during the interwar period. The Nelson Class had it own type of torpedo, the 24inch Mark I. They even developed a aircraft launched torpedo the 18inch Mark XI."
 sub_rn_magnetic_detonators:0 "Magnetic Detonators"
 sub_rn_magnetic_detonators_desc:0 "While initially quite unreliable, once they had been refined magnetic detonators made torpedoes more effective."
 sub_rn_electric_torpedoes:0 "Electric Torpedoes"
 sub_rn_electric_torpedoes_desc:0 "Quieter and leaving far less wake (making it harder for the target to see the incoming danger), electric torpedoes were another significant step forward in torpedo technology."
 sub_rn_advanced_torpedoes:0 "Advanced Torpedoes"
 sub_rn_advanced_torpedoes_desc:0 "Improvements in reliability, aiming (including rudimentary homing devices) and other areas made the torpedoes coming into service at the end of the war very dangerous indeed."

 leaf_suspension_desc:0 " A leaf spring takes the form of a slender arc-shaped length of spring steel of rectangular cross-section. In the most common configuration, the center of the arc provides location for the axle, while loops formed at either end provide for attaching to the vehicle chassis. For very heavy vehicles, a leaf spring can be made from several leaves stacked on top of each other in several layers, often with progressively shorter leaves. Leaf springs can serve locating and to some extent damping as well as springing functions. While the interleaf friction provides a damping action, it is not well controlled and results in stiction in the motion of the suspension"
 christie_suspension:0 "Christie Suspension"

 horstmann_suspension:0 "Horstmann Suspension"
 horstmann_suspension_desc:0 "The principal design feature is that two or more wheels are mounted to a common framework. Each wheel is mounted on an L-shaped swing arm that forms a bell crank, so the upward movement of the wheel is turned into sideways motion of the top of the crank. The two arms may be mounted on a common pivot shaft between them, or more commonly, two closely spaced shafts. The two wheels share a coil spring running horizontally between the tops of the crank arms. Thus if one wheel moves up over an obstacle, the spring is compressed against the swing arm of the other wheel"
 torsion_suspension:0 "Torsion Suspension"
 torsion_suspension_desc:0 "A torsion bar suspension, also known as a torsion spring suspension, is any vehicle suspension that uses a torsion bar as its main weight-bearing spring. One end of a long metal bar is attached firmly to the vehicle chassis; the opposite end terminates in a lever, the torsion key, mounted perpendicular to the bar, that is attached to a suspension arm, a spindle, or the axle. Vertical motion of the wheel causes the bar to twist around its axis and is resisted by the bar's torsion resistance. The effective spring rate of the bar is determined by its length, cross section, shape, material, and manufacturing process. "

By comparing the signals received on the two virtual loops, the direction to the signal can be determined using existing RDF techniques. Researchers had set up the antenna in 1919 but had been neglecting it in favour of smaller designs. These were found to have very poor performance due to the electrical characteristics of the Slough area, which made it difficult to determine if a signal was being received on a straight line or down from the sky. Smith-Rose and Barfield turned their attention back to the Adcock antenna, which had no horizontal component and thus filtered out the \"skywaves\". In a series of follow-up experiments they were able to accurately determine the location of transmitters around the country."

Earlier systems used a mechanically rotated antenna (or solenoid) and an operator listening for peaks or nulls in the signal, which took considerable time to determine, often on the order of a minute or more. HF/DF's display made the same measurement essentially instantaneously, which allowed it to catch fleeting signals, such as those from the U-boat fleet. "
