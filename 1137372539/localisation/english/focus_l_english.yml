The weapon was too late for widespread use in Europe but proved itself in the battle of Okinawa for its ability to quickly lay down suppressive fire. It combined a perfect balance of long-range accuracy with short range burst capacity which became the priority for all future US service rifles. The M2 was one of the primary US weapons equipping troops in the Korean war and remained in use through the 1960s."

Validation of the new US focus was provided with the major victory at the battle of Midway in 1942.

Göring intended for the units to be restricted to defensive duties in quieter fronts, however many units were used on the Eastern Front."

These recommendations brought the addition of 1,500 men per month and saw the transfer of inexperienced Luftwaffe personnel to the army panzer divisions for 'on the job training' and experienced panzer officers and NCOs were transferred the HG Division. All tanks and other equipment (apart from Flak guns) were supplied by the army.

 GER_rocketry_ruhrstahl_desc:5 "The R4M (Rakete, 4Kilogramm, Minenkopf) rocket, nicknamed the Hurricane (Orkan) due to its distinctive smoke trail when fired, was an anti-aircraft rocket. The anti-aircraft version of the R4M used a large warhead of 55 mm with 520 g. of the strongly brisant Hexogen explosive charge, nearly guaranteeing a fighter kill with one hit, from the \"shattering\" force of its explosive warhead — this was the same explosive used in the shells fired by both the MK 103 and MK 108 autocannons. Each R4M weighed 3.2 kg and was provided with enough fuel to be fired from 1000 m, just outside the range of the bomber's defensive guns. The main body of the rocket consisted of a simple steel tube with eight base-hinged flip-out fins on the tail for stabilisation, deployed immediately after launch. A battery typically consisted of two groups of 12 rockets and when all 24 were salvoed in an attack, they would fill an area about 15 by 30 m at 1000 m, a density that made it almost certain that the target would be hit. The R4Ms were usually fired in four salvos of six missiles at intervals of 70 milliseconds from a range of 600 m, and would supersonically streak towards their target at a sixty percent higher velocity than the Wfr. Gr. 21's rockets would (the BR 21's projectile travelled at some 1150 km/h post-launch), as the R4M typically had a flight speed of roughly 1,890 km/h (1,175 mph). Two warheads were available for the R4M, the common PB-3 with a 0.4 kg charge for anti-aircraft use and the larger shaped charge, similar in construction to the Panzerschreck, the Panzerblitz (PB-2/3), for anti-tank use. The Panzerblitz III, mounting a gigantic 210 mm hollow charge warhead (the same calibre as the BR 21), can be seen as the ultimate development of the basic Orkan rocket. It was intended to be carried (six or eight rockets per plane) by the tank-busting B model of the Henschel Hs 132 jet dive-bomber"

Two similar guns were used to bombard Luxembourg from December 1944 to February 1945. The V-3 was also known as the Hochdruckpumpe (High Pressure Pump, HDP for short), which was a code name intended to hide the real purpose of the project. It was also known as Fleißiges Lieschen (Busy Lizzie)."
 GER_vortex_cannon:5 "Vortex Cannon"
 GER_vortex_cannon_desc:5 "The Wind Cannon was developed by a factory in Stuttgart during the war. It was a type of gun that would eject a jet of compressed air against enemy aircraft. It was a strange device consisted of a large angled barrel like a bent arm resting in an immense cradle like some enormous broken pea-shooter lying askew. The cannon worked by the ignition of critical mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen in molecular proportions as near as possible. The powerful explosion triggered off a rapidly-ejected projectile of compressed air and water vapor, which, like a solid 'shot' of air, was as effective as a small shell. Experimental trials of the cannon at Hillersleben demonstrated that a 25mm-thick wooden board could be broken at 200m. Nitrogen peroxide was deployed in some of the experiments so that the brown colour would allow the path and destination of the otherwise transparent projectile to be observed and photographed. The tests proved that a powerful region of compressed and high-velocity air could be deployed with sufficient force to inflict some damage. However, the aerodynamics of a flying aircraft would almost surely have neutralized the effectiveness of this cannon. In addition, the effects of the cannon on a fast-flying aircraft was quite different from that on a fixed ground target. Still, the cannon was installed on a bridge over the Elbe, but with no significant results, either because there were no aircraft or simply no successes (as one might suspect). The wind cannon was an interesting experiment but a practical failure."
 GER_Sonic_Cannon:5 "Sonic Cannon"
 GER_Sonic_Cannon_desc:5 "During the early 1940s Nazi engineers had managed to develop a sonic cannon that could literally shake a person apart from the inside. Or at least that’s what they claimed. Designed by Dr. Richard Wallauschek, the cannon consisted of a methane gas combustion chamber leading to two large parabolic reflectors, the final version of which had a diameter over 3m. The 'dishes' were pulse detonated at around 44Hz and were connected to a chamber composed of several sub-units firing tubes. These tubes would allow a mixture of methane and oxygen in the combustion chamber, which when ignited, would turn these gases into noise that could kill. This infrasound, magnified by the dish reflectors, caused vertigo and nausea at 300 yards by vibrating the middle ear bones and shaking the cochlear fluid within the inner ear. Apparently, the sound waves created pressures that could kill a man 50 meters away in half a minute. To say the least, this is very unconvincing, since this supposed Sonic cannon was only tested on laboratory animals, and was never tested on human beings. Either or, in practice this thing would have been very vulnerable to enemy fire, since if the parabolic reflectors were damaged, it would render this weapon completely useless."
 GER_Landkreuzer:5 "Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte"
 GER_Landkreuzer_desc:5 "The Landkreuzer P. 1000 'Ratte' (Land Cruiser P. 1000 'Rat') was a design for a super-heavy tank, proposed by Krupp director Edward Grotte in June 1942. Submitted designs and drawings of the tank went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. The tank was planned to be 1000 metric tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII 'Maus', the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes). The Ratte's primary weapon would have been a dual 280 mm SK C/28 gun turret. This was the same turret that was used on the German capital ship Gneisenau but modified by removing one of the guns and its associated loading mechanism. Removing the third gun allowed extra accommodation of ammunition, and reduced the total weight of the tank by 50 tonnes. The guns used for the Ratte would have fired ammunition developed for other naval guns. It also included armour-piercing rounds with 8.1 kg of explosive filler, and high-explosive rounds with 17.1 kg of explosive filler. Further armament was to consist of a 128 mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15 mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20 mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four of them as a Flakvierling quad mount. The 128 mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing that it would have been mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system. The project gained the approval of Adolf Hitler, who had expressed interest in the development of the tank, but was cancelled by Minister of Armaments Albert Speer in early 1943. The large size and weight would have rendered the tank unable to cross bridges at the risk of collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40 kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels."

However, with the fall of France and the occupation of Norway, new U-boat bases were made available which were much more strategically advantageous due to their proximity to the Atlantic. Construction priorities then shifted from bunkers in Germany to those in the occupied countries. There were also plans for building complete bunkered shipyards, fully equipped and self-sufficient with dry docks for major repairs and construction, but there were always other more pressing or urgent needs that these never saw fruition.

The unit was officially activated on 14 June 1939, and the occasion was marked by a parade through the streets of the capital. The regiment was being reorganized in September 1939, and did not take part in Fall Weiss (the invasion of Poland), a fact that dented the pride of the regiment which bore the name of the nation on their sleeves.

Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth, and Richard Walther Darré, the Ahnenerbe group later conducted experiments and launched expeditions to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world. Originally, the official mission of Ahnenerbe was to find new evidence of the racial heritage of the Germanic people; however, due to Himmler's obsession with occultism it quickly became his own occult tool and started using pseudoscience. The group was formerly called the Study Society for Primordial Intellectual history, German Ancestral Heritage (Studiengesellschaft fur Geistesurgeschichte‚ Deutsches Ahnenerbe), but it was renamed in 1937 as the Research and Teaching Community of the Ancestral Heritage (Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft des Ahnenerbe)."

 GER_die_glocke:5 "Die Glocke"
 GER_die_glocke_desc:5 "Allegedly an experiment carried out by Third Reich scientists working for the SS in a German facility known as Der Riese (The Giant) near the Wenceslaus mine and close to the Czech border, Die Glocke is a device 'made out of a hard, heavy metal' approximately 2.7 metres wide and 3.7 to 4.6 metres high, having a shape like that of a large bell. According to an interview of Witkowski by Cook, this device ostensibly contained two counter-rotating cylinders which would be 'filled with a mercury-like substance, violet in colour'. This metallic liquid was code-named 'Xerum 525' and was 'stored in a tall thin thermos flask a meter high encased in lead'. Additional substances said to be employed in the experiments, referred to as Leichtmetall (light metal), 'included thorium and beryllium peroxides'. Witkowski describes Die Glocke, when activated, as having an effect zone extending out 150 to 200 metres. Within the zone, crystals would form in animal tissue, blood would gel & separate while plants would decompose into a grease like substance. Witkowski also said that five of the seven original scientists working on the project died during the tests. Based upon certain external indications, Witkowski states that the ruins of a concrete framework, aesthetically dubbed 'The Henge', near the Wenceslas mine, some 3.1 kilometres southeast of the main Complex Sokolec underground works of Project Riese, may have once served as a test rig for an experiment in 'anti-gravity propulsion' generated with Die Glocke. However, the derelict structure itself has also been interpreted to resemble the remains of a conventional industrial cooling tower. Witkowski’s statements along with Cook’s views prompted further conjecture about the device from various American authors, including Joseph P. Farrell, Jim Marrs, and Henry Stevens. In his book, Hitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology (2007), Stevens concludes that the violet mercury-like substance described by Witkowski could only be red mercury because normal mercury 'has no fluid compounds according to conventional wisdom'. Stevens presents a story attributed to German scientist Otto Cerny as told to then 13-year-old Greg Rowe around 1961 which alleged that a concave mirror on top of a device which seemed similar in description to Die Glocke provided the ability to see 'images from the past during its operation.'"

 GER_Goerings_art:5 "Göring's Art Collection"
 GER_Goerings_art_desc:5 "Hermann Göring’s personal art log is a twisted treasure map, a guide to looting and pillaging and gift-giving among the Nazi brass, and a tracking mechanism for the Nazi occupation of Europe. It has long been known that Göring was among the most zealous of Nazi art collectors: at the end of the war, he packed the booty stored at Carinhall into trains and fled south toward Berchtesgaden, in Bavaria, as he blew up Carinhall behind him. The collection was discovered by Allied soldiers, and, in 1945, the New York Times pegged the worth of the works at two hundred million dollars (part of a slew of breathless American coverage, according to Nancy Yeide, the author of 'Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Göring Collection'). The catalogue of Göring’s art provides a perversely fascinating yardstick for the changing taste of a man known for personal eccentricities as well as horrifying brutality. The emphasis, at first, is on northern European Romanticism, along with the nude female form. But the collection shifts, becomes more expansive, and, occasionally, eschews the Nazi laws on so-called degenerate art to scoop up some of the modern greats. 'I fully admit I had a passion for collection,' Göring said on the witness stand at Nuremberg, with a 'vulpine' smile, according to Janet Flanner, who reported from the trial for The New Yorker. 'And if they were to be confiscated, I wanted my small part.'"

He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.

It was constructed by Organisation Todt. The top secret, high security site was in the Masurian woods about 8 km east of the small East Prussian town of Rastenburg. Three security zones surrounded the central complex where the Führer's bunker was located. These were guarded by personnel from the SS Reichssicherheitsdienst and the Wehrmacht's armoured Führerbegleitbrigade. Despite the security, the most notable assassination attempt against Hitler was made at the Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944. Hitler first arrived at the headquarters on 23 June 1941. In total, he spent more than 800 days at the Wolfsschanze during a 3.5-year period until his final departure on 20 November 1944. In mid-1944, work began to enlarge and reinforce many of the Wolf's Lair original buildings.

In the plant, which was run by Steyr-Daimler-Puch, over half of all Panzer IV tanks were produced up until the end of World War II. Of the 8500 Panzer IV tanks produced by Germany during the war, around 4800 came from here. Under the German four-year plan, after the annexation of Austria, an armaments centre was created in Linz, which included, among other things, the manufacture of armour plates at the Upper Danube Ironworks for the Nibelungen works which was itself responsible for the final assembly of tanks. The latter resulted from plans from 1939 to build an arms factory at the railway junction town of Saint Valentin for 65 million Reichsmark. The official opening took place in 1942. When completed, the monthly production capacity was intended to be 320 tanks, but this was never achieved. Late in the war (early 1945), the factory was also used in the repair of tanks coming from the frontlines (which were only a few km away at that point). It is estimated that around 50 Panthers were repaired in Nibelungen Works."

Though early monoplanes were obsolete by the time they entered service, the approaching of war spurred further development of newer models such as the P-39 Airacobra, the P-40 Warhawk and the P-38 Lightening which all flew by 1939."
USA_CAS:0 "CAS Effort"
USA_CAS_desc:0 "With the Army Air Corps focus on strategic bombing in the lead up to WWII, close air support had stagnated in US doctrine. The war in Europe however showed that CAS had an important role to play and as such Air support commander began to be assigned to ground combat units in the lead up to the invasion of North Africa. Throughout the campaign the need for better CAS integration became more widely realized and fighter aircraft began flying interdiction and strafing attacks against ground targets."

USA_north_america_avi_desc:5 "Originally founded in 1928, the company began manufacturing operations in 19334. NAA geared up for war and its T-6 Texan became the most widely produced trainer ever, totaling over 17,000 units. The company achieved wide success as well with the B-25 Mitchell which was used in the Doolittle Raid of 1942 and saw combat in all theaters. NAAs greatest achievement was probably the P-51 Mustang which, once fitted with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, became the greatest US fighter of the war and arguably one of the greatest aircraft of all time."
USA_rolls_royce:5 "Rolls-Royce Effort"
USA_rolls_royce_desc:5 "During the development of the P-51 Mustang, RAF test pilots were favorably impressed with the aircraft but noted a significant decrease in performance above 15,000ft where much of the fighting was then taking place. Ronald Harker, an RR test pilot, suggested the aircraft be fitted with a Merlin 61which gave the aircraft a top speed of 440mph up to 28,000ft. The US adopted this and the P-51B began equipping the 8th and 9th air forces in 1943-44."

Grumman had the distinction of producing more aircraft for the US than any other company during the war, delivering 654 in March 1945 alone. The major aircraft of the war from Grumman were the F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, and the TBF Avenger each of which played a pivotal role in the Pacific Theater. – the F4F in fact being credited by some as the aircraft that saved the US war in the Pacific."
USA_new_sea_combat:5 "Adopt New Type of Sea Combat"
USA_new_sea_combat_desc:5 "The vulnerabilities of major capital ships to aircraft were exposed during the 1920s which resulted in the rise of naval aviation. The Japanese ‘Kido Butai’ proved the striking capability of a carrier-based fleet and, following the loss of the majority of US Battleships in the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the US turned to expanding its own Carrier based fleet. Validation of the new US focus was provided with the major victory at the battle of Midway in 1942. The aircraft carrier changed the face of naval warfare and became the primary asset of any major fleet through the second world war."

USA_foreign_tank_inspiration_desc:5 "With the German invasion of Western Europe in 1940, the US came to the realization that its tank design was woefully inadequate to face modern armor. German propaganda of its ‘blitzkrieg’ pushed the US to fully motorize and reimagine tank design – specifically that battle tanks be armed with a minimum of a 75mm gun to be able to match German armor. This led directly to the development of the US Main medium tank of the war, the M4 Sherman."
USA_medium_tank:5 "The Army's Medium Tank"

In August 1940, the National Guard was ordered into federal service for 12 months. More than 400,000 guardsmen were called up serving in divisions, non-divisional units, and Army Air Force squadrons. The calling up of the National Guard doubled the size of the United States Army (USA).

The speech intensified America's isolationist mood, causing protest by non-interventionists and foes to intervene. No countries were directly mentioned in the speech, although it was interpreted as referring to the Empire of Japan, the Kingdom of Italy, and Nazi Germany. Roosevelt suggested the use of economic pressure, a forceful response, but less direct than outright aggression. Public response to the speech was mixed"

Some 45 million identity cards were issued over the course of World War 2.\n\nThree main reasons for the introduction of the identity cards were:\n\n1. The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions. The National Register was in fact an instant census and the National Registration Act closely resembles the Census Act 1920 in many ways."

However, Seymour de Lotbiniere ("Lobby"), who was responsible for live sports coverage and who went on to become an outstanding head of outside broadcasts at the BBC, realised that ball-by-ball commentary could make compelling radio. In the mid-1930s he got Howard Marshall to begin commentating on cricket, rather than only giving reports. From the mid-1930s to the 1950s the amount of ball-by-ball commentary gradually increased, but it was not until TMS was launched in 1957 that every ball was covered for their British audience. \n\nRobert Hudson was responsible for the launch of TMS, writing to his Outside Broadcasts boss Charles Max-Muller in 1956, proposing broadcasting full ball-by-ball coverage of Tests rather than only covering fixed periods, and suggesting using the Third Programme (as BBC Radio 3 was then known) frequency, since at that time the Third Programme only broadcast in the evening."

The British Army had abandoned most of its equipment in France after the Dunkirk evacuation. It was therefore decided to build a static system of defensive lines around Britain, all designed to compartmentalise the country and delay the Germans long enough for more mobile forces to counter-attack. Over 50 defensive lines were constructed around Britain. After the coastal defences, the GHQ Line was the longest and most important, designed to protect London and the industrial heart of Britain and was Britain's last chance of defence. "

The Spitfire achieved legendary status during the Battle of Britain, a reputation aided by the famous Spitfire Fund organised and run by Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production.\n\nAlthough the key aim of Fighter Command was to stop the Luftwaffe's bombers, in practice the tactic was to use Spitfires to counter German escort fighters, particularly the Bf 109s, while the Hurricane squadrons attacked the bombers. "
 ENG_beaverbrook:5 "Appoint Lord Beaverbrook"
 ENG_beaverbrook_desc:5 "William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, appointed Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production. With Churchill's blessing Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of war-time aircraft production; he increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the Air Ministry. His appeal for pots and pans 'to make Spitfires' was afterwards revealed by his son Sir Max Aitken to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a Time Magazine cover story declared, 'Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line.' Under Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: 'His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour.' Beaverbrook's impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energised production at a time when it was desperately needed. However, it has been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit. Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that 'We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air, but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so.' "

 ENG_POA_desc:5 "The people of East London rallied to Cable Street and forced back the march of the fascist Oswald Mosley and his black shirts through the streets of the East End.  THEY SHALL NOT PASS, The Battle of Cable Street was a major factor leading to the passage of the Public Order Act 1936, which required police consent for political marches and forbade the wearing of political uniforms in public.  This is widely considered to be a significant factor in the BUF's political decline prior to the Second World War. The Act banned the wearing of political uniforms in any public place or public meeting.  It also required police consent for political marches to go ahead.  The Act also prohibited organising, training or equipping an association of persons for the purpose of enabling them to be employed in usurping the functions of the police or of the armed forces of the Crown, or for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political object.\n\nThe Act had the indirect result of actually improving the stance of the BUF.  Their forced abandonment of paramilitary and armed tactics improved the party's relations with the police, and in making it more respectable increased the BUF appeal among traditionally conservative middle-class citizens who became the party's main base in the years after the Public Order Act 1936 was passed."

We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.

Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day, but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate, careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power.

The inventor of the first such bomb was the British engineer Barnes Wallis, whose 'Upkeep' bouncing bomb was used in the RAF's Operation Chastise of May 1943 to bounce into German dams and explode underwater, with effect similar to the underground detonation of the Grand Slam and Tallboy earthquake bombs, both of which he also invented."

 FRA_1936_election_crisis_desc:0 "The 1936 Legislative Elections were among the most tumultuous in all of French history. Record numbers of candidates vied for power, with over a thousand candidates coming from just the Seine Department. With a frightening rise in political violence, and radical parties growing rapidly in power, the 1936 elections would be the ultimate test for the Third Republic.\n\nThe Popular Front (Front Populaire), a loose-knit coalition of different leftist political parties, narrowly won the election. However, the Popular Front didn't win enough seats in the Senate to make their own majority. In order to create a stable government, the Popular Front sided with the French Communists to form a majority."

 FRA_arrest_union_leaders_desc:0 "The labor unions have crossed the line and we must deal with them. We will arrest the leaders of the larger unions. This will undoubtably enrage the average worker and will prolong the strikes, but if we hold out long enough, we will inevitably win."
 FRA_ban_commie_newspapers:0 "Ban Communist Newspapers"
 FRA_ban_commie_newspapers_desc:0 "L'Humanité along with the other large Communist newspapers are among those responsible for the current strikes. These papers have always criticized our government and divided our people. We must ban these newspapers and keep these dangerous ideas from gaining anymore ground."
 FRA_crush_strikers:0 "Crush the Union Strikers!"
 FRA_crush_strikers_desc:0 "The union strikers are now leaderless and are growing increasingly disorganized. This is our chance to break some of these strikes and start bringing our industries back online. We just need to hold out a bit longer and the rest of the strikes will dissolve as well."
 FRA_deregulate_arms_industry:0 "Deregulate the Arms Industry"
 FRA_deregulate_arms_industry_desc:0 "The French arms industry has been stifled by over-regulation for far too long. French arms companies cannot export weapons to other nations, have suffered from disorganized and ineffective government contracts, and haven’t had the freedom to develop new modern weapons.\n\nOur government is not effective enough to both babysit the arms industry and improve the stagnant economy. If we free the arms industry from these burdensome regulations, we can focus our government on improving the economy."

Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviets are rapidly arming themselves for war. We are already dangerously far behind in this newly evolving arms race and we must catch up quickly.\n\nOur army needs new modern equipment as quickly as possible. To that end, we will nationalize the nation’s military industry and assume direct control over our nation’s arms production. We will focus our government’s resources on rearmament – even if the economy suffers as a result."

 FRA_spain_crisis_desc:0 "France was bitterly divided over how to respond to the Spanish Civil War. Conservative and socialist politicians alike did not want to intervene in the conflict. The scars of the Great War had yet to fully heal, and France's military was weakened by years of neglect. The UK was also opposed to intervention and would not aid France war escalated into another Great War with the fascist powers of Germany and Italy.\n\nHowever, the communists wanted to aid Republican Spain no matter the cost. In their eyes, if the communist revolution succeeded in Spain, it would bolster communism in France. The French Communist Party has won enough seats in the Senate to force the issue. We can no longer ignore the conflict raging just south of our boarder, we must choose a side.”

France is now in crisis; people will soon no longer be able to afford food and housing.\n\nWe must make a choice, to pass further reforms to try to stabilize the currency or tear apart the progressive reforms of the Popular Front to save the economy.

 ENG_Gurkha_focus:5 "Gurkha Battalions"
 ENG_Gurkha_focus_desc:5 "There were ten Gurkha regiments, with two battalions each making a total of twenty pre-war battalions. Following the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in 1940, the Nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to increase the total number of Gurkha battalions in British service to thirty-five. This would eventually rise to forty-three battalions. To achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR. This expansion required ten training centres to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions were raised, while other units were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas. Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialised functions such as Para troops, signals, engineers, and military police. A total of 250000 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, plus Parachute, training, garrison, and porter units during the war, in almost all theatres. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in Syria, North Africa, Italy, Greece and against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, northeast India and Singapore.  They did so with considerable distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theatres."

These Senators believe that any further disassociation with Britain would be detrimental to the economy of Ireland — of course, there are also more purely economically-minded Senators who have observed the devastating effects of the Anglo-Irish Trade War, which they say was caused in part by de Valera's government.\nSuch economic concerns come second in priority of achieving our much needed sovereignty.

It is time this is immediately repealed, with a new Constitution to be put into place. Although the new Constitution will be similar to its predecessor, all references to the King and the Governor-General will be totally removed. However, this Constitution will require the approval of the Irish people via plebiscite, but there is no doubt that the majority would vote in favour. Alas, true independence has come. We are no longer the Irish Free State, but simply Éire — Ireland."
 IRE_coalcattle_pact:5 "Coal-Cattle Pact"
 IRE_coalcattle_pact_desc:5 "The Anglo-Irish Trade War was started by President de Valera in the October of 1932, soon after Fianna Fáil's victory in the election. Refusing to pay land annuities issued by the British government before the War of Independence, the British retaliated by instituting tarrifs on Irish trade with Britain. Naturally, with Britain being Ireland's largest trading partner, the economy greatly suffered. This came in line with the protectionist policies of the government, which sought to expand Irish native industry and production — to the detriment of prices and the cost of living. After several years of economic hardship, it is clear the Irish industry being largely agricultural-based is unable to sustain itself without extensive trade with Britain. It is time we begin to resolve the Trade War that has developed between our two nations. Under the guise of Minister for Industry and Commerce Seán Lemass, talks have begun and Britain has agreed to sign the Coal-Cattle Pact with Ireland — a huge leap forward in the diplomatic process between Ireland and the United Kingdom."

 IRE_ccp_desc:5 "By 1934, tensions in the Anglo-Irish Trade War were at an all-time high. The two countries have raised tariffs on each other’s products. The restrictions on Irish Beef and British Coal in particular, however, seem to have driven some sense back into both sides. The pact saw both nations reduce tariffs and quotas, easing tensions and the impact of the ongoing trade war. Some within Irish circles remain upset, however, convinced the British got the better deal. The old cry of “Burn everything British except their coal” seems to indicate that anti-british opinion is still very much alive."

Late in the ongoing Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, the British indicated they would be willing to release the ports. Under pressure at home to ease the trade war, the Irish government entered talks in 1937, with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain eventually agreeing to cede the ports back to the Irish unconditionally as a goodwill gesture. It would be finally completed in 1938 with the signing of the Eire Confirmation Agreements and the end of the Trade War."

Ships were acquired from various nations and were critical in allowing the Irish to maintain its neutrality during the war…a policy it likely would’ve been forced to abandon by 1941 otherwise."

On-going high-level talks finally saw the agreement to end tariffs imposed by both nations and resolved the initial dispute of Irish payments of land annuities that initially started the trade war. On this, the Irish government agreed to pay a final 10 million, a significant savings from the estimated remaining payment. The British also confirmed the transfer of the so called ‘Treaty Ports’ originally guaranteed to the British military. The British government notably referred to Ireland by the Irish name ‘Eire’ not ‘Ireland’ thus avoiding the contentious issue of the North of Ireland remaining a part of Great Britain."

We should do this on a trial basis to see if they're capable of doing proper military signals work thus allowing us to free up yet more men for service aboard ships.

 NZL_armor_m3:5 "License M3 Lee Design"
 NZL_armor_m3_desc:5 "Should British designs prove unsuitable or delayed, we can seek the assistance of the great Arsenal of Democracy. Historically, Canada built licensed M3 chassis for their Ram Tanks, although they did not see combat."
 NZL_armor_m4:5 "License M4 Sherman Design"
 NZL_armor_m4_desc:5 "The M3 was succeeded by the superior Sherman. Historically the Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and Canada produced their own version under license as the Grizzly."
 NZL_armor_salvage:5 "Refurbish Salvaged Equipment"
 NZL_armor_salvage_desc:5 "The spoils of war belong to the victor. Our forces in the field have 'acquired' some damaged or abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles of various types. These can be put back in the field under new ownership with a modest amount of effort."
 NZL_mechanization_effort:5 "Mechanisation of Support Arms"
 NZL_mechanization_effort_desc:5 "We can focus our planning efforts on increased mechanisation of our infantry and their support arms."
 # Army Planning
 NZL_prewar_studies:5 "Council of Defence"

 NZL_reorganise_army:5 "Reorganise Army"
 NZL_reorganise_army_desc:5 "The requirements of modern warfare require change. We can open army schools, improve training facilities, and implement increased mechanisation of our infantry and support arms."
 NZL_2NZEF:5 "Form the 2NZEF"
 NZL_2NZEF_desc:5 "New Zealanders in combat will probably be doing so well distant to our shores. Only abroad can those who threaten our interests be defeated. We can start creating the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force."
 NZL_home_guard:5 "Form the Home Guard"
 NZL_home_guard_desc:5 "We can form a volunteer militia for home defence."
 NZL_coastal_forts:5 "Upgrade Coastal Defences"
 NZL_coastal_forts_desc:5 "We have a series of obsolete coastal fortifications dating from WW1 or the Russian scare of 1885. These can be upgraded, and new posts established."
 NZL_operations_europe:5 "Planning Effort for Europe"
 NZL_operations_europe_desc:5 "The defining conflict will be once again in Western Europe, where our fallen from the last War lie from Flanders Fields and the Somme."
 NZL_operations_middle_east:5 "Planning Effort for Middle East"
 NZL_operations_middle_east_desc:5 "Just as we fought in the Suez, Sinai and Palestine in the Great War, so we may be asked to fight again in the scorching sands. Our lines of supply are shorter here, and the Commonwealth sees us as hardy colonials suited to hard terrain."
 NZL_operations_pacific:5 "Planning Effort for Pacific"
 NZL_operations_pacific_desc:5 "Our home cannot be neglected. The security of the Pacific has always required any attacker from the North to be delayed until the Royal Navy can muster its strength."
 # Aviation
 NZL_aviation_effort:5 "An Independent RNZAF"
 NZL_aviation_effort_desc:5 "Airpower will be a dominant force. Our growing air force must be able to evolve independently of the army if we are to take full advantage."
 NZL_light_airframe:5 "Light Airframe Planning"
 NZL_light_airframe_desc:5 "Our workforce and airmen are intelligent and adaptable. We can plan for the construction and use of light airframes."
 NZL_aviation_effort2:5 "Airfield Construction"

 NZL_british_aircraft_desc:5 "Our ties with the Mother Country are strong. Negotiations can proceed for technical assistance with a number of aircraft designs."
 NZL_NAV_effort:5 "Air Patrols over the Pacific"
 NZL_NAV_effort_desc:5 "The distances to be covered in the South Pacific are vast, and our naval forces few. Aircraft are an efficient means of keeping watch over the waters to our north."
 # Commonwealth
 NZL_assist_RAF:5 "Transfer Bombers and Crews to RAF"
 NZL_assist_RAF_desc:5 "Where Britain goes, we go. Where she stands, we stand. We have a purchasing option for 30 bombers, with crew training in the UK. Let us offer these to the RAF. Historically the New Zealand Wellington bomber flight then became No.75 (NZ) Squadron RAF."
 NZL_assist_RAF2:5 "Join the BCATP"
 NZL_assist_RAF2_desc:5 "The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was a massive joint aircrew training program created by the UK, Canada, Australia and NZ. New Zealand went on to provide 2,743 pilots for the RAF during the war."

 NZL_technology_sharing_comm:5 "Commonwealth Mutual Aid"
 NZL_technology_sharing_comm_desc:5 "Great Britain and the Commonwealth appreciate our hard work on behalf of the alliance.

 NZL_radio_industry:5 "Radio Industry"
 NZL_radio_industry_desc:5 "Our fledgling radio industry is expanding rapidly to cope with our own needs. We can expand further to export additional radios and even radar units to our allies."
 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:5 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:5 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:5 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:5 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:5 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:5 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry. Historically, shipyard expansion for repairs and the construction of minesweepers and smaller craft occurred from 1940. However, our citizens and policies support industrialisation, and we can focus on shipbuilding now if we so choose."
 NZL_navy_doctrine:5 "Our Place in the World"
 NZL_navy_doctrine_desc:5 "We are a small country dependent on the sea to sell the products of our labour, and receive vital imports. Freedom of the seas is critical for our survival. How or if we go about contributing to this is up to us."
 NZL_minesweepers:5 "Construct Minesweepers"
 NZL_minesweepers_desc:5 "Rearmament has begun, and there is a never-ending demand for escorts and other small ships. We can make plans to construct minesweepers to protect our ports and trade, which will also give our shipbuilders valuable experience."
 NZL_destroyer_effort2:5 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:5 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:5 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:5 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."
 NZL_cruiser_effort:5 "British Cruiser Designs"
 NZL_cruiser_effort_desc:5 "Cruisers have long patrolled the South Pacific, being a versatile and balanced ship with adequate range. Perhaps it is time we constructed our own."
 NZL_us_programme:5 "United States Programme"
 NZL_us_programme_desc:5 "The United States has enquired whether our country can construct smaller craft such as tow boats, tugs and powered lighters for the Pacific. We have no steel-workers not already engaged on essential work. However, we can rapidly retrain and supervise carpenters and other trainees, use coachbuilding firms, and bring in steel-workers from the Railway Workshops. Historically over 100 vessels were built."
 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:5 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:5 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."
 NZL_fiji_focus2:5 "Reinforce Fiji"
 NZL_fiji_focus2_desc:5 "We can further develop the installations in our northern neighbour."
 # Look Outside the Commonwealth
 NZL_technology_sharing:5 "Mutual Aid"
 NZL_technology_sharing_desc:5 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime R&D more efficiently."
 NZL_political_effort:5 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:5 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
 NZL_collectivist_ethos:5 "Collectivist Ethos"
 NZL_collectivist_ethos_desc:5 "Our enemies may divide and conquer lesser nations, but our people will stand united. All for one and one for all."

 NZL_neutrality_focus:5 "Neutrality Focus"
 NZL_neutrality_focus_desc:5 "While others may claim it takes bravery and wisdom to take sides in a global conflict, we know it takes more to refuse."

 NZL_interventionism_focus_desc:5 "We value the freedom of all people, not only our own citizens. If preventing tyranny means war, then so be it."
 NZL_military_youth:5 "Military Youth"
 NZL_military_youth_desc:5 "Organizations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early."
 NZL_deterrence:5 "Deterrence"
 NZL_deterrence_desc:5 "Standing alone, we rarely benefit from war. Fortunately, we know that the best defence is one so well-known you never have to put it to use."
 NZL_volunteer_corps:5 "Volunteer Corps"
 NZL_volunteer_corps_desc:5 "Forcing our people to die for ideals of freedom would be an exercise in irony, but establishing means for those who wish to aid people abroad is not."
 NZL_paramilitarism:5 "Para militarism"
 NZL_paramilitarism_desc:5 "Military principles have applications outside of the military. With the development of semi-militarized units to complement our armed forces, more people will have military training."
 NZL_indoctrination_focus:5 "Indoctrination"
 NZL_indoctrination_focus_desc:5 "Having established our ideology as based on the truth, it may be taught as truth. Education and media must reflect this lesson."
 NZL_foreign_expeditions:5 "Foreign Expeditions"
 NZL_foreign_expeditions_desc:5 "With our enemies prepared to intervene in distant conflicts on behalf of their ideals, we must be ready to do the same for ours."
 NZL_why_we_fight:5 "Why We Fight"

 NZL_nationalism_focus:5 "Nationalism Focus"
 NZL_nationalism_focus_desc:5 "Our nation is unique, and our political achievements could only have happened here. We must fight for it at any cost."
 NZL_ideological_fanaticism:5 "Ideological Fanaticism"
 NZL_ideological_fanaticism_desc:5 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death."

 BALTIC_soviet_equipment:0 "Soviet Equipment"
 BALTIC_soviet_equipment_desc:0 "We cannot hope to topple the government without first gaining access to weapons and materials necessary to arm our militia. By reaching out to the Russians for assistance, we will gain extra armaments to support our armies, should the old government attempt to halt the revolution."
 BALTIC_soviet_volunteer_forces:0 "Soviet Volunteer Forces"
 BALTIC_soviet_volunteer_forces_desc:0 "The USSR is practically overflowing with men ready to fight and die for the world revolution. Though [Root.GetNameDef] is just a mere stepping-stone in the fight for a communist world, there is no shortage of brave Russian socialists ready to die for our cause."
 BALTIC_soviet_military_staff:0 "Soviet Military Staff"
 BALTIC_soviet_military_staff_desc:0 "After the [Root.GetAdjective] Worker’s Republic was disbanded, our military staff largely went into exile in the USSR. They must be brought home."
 BALTIC_communist_opposition:0 "Enter Opposition"
 BALTIC_communist_opposition_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has proven itself to be no friend to [Root.GetNameDef] nor its people and we would be fools to hand the keys to [Root.GetNameDef] over to the vultures of the Red Army who want nothing more than to plunder the [Root.GetAdjective]. They are no more trustworthy than the capitalists, and if the [Root.GetCommunistParty] are to succeed, it must be done alone!"
 BALTIC_forment_disloyalty:0 "Unite the Opposition"
 BALTIC_forment_disloyalty_desc:0 "There are many movements both within and without the [Root.GetAdjective] government and if we are to overthrow the current tyranny that plagues [Root.GetNameDef], we must become the unifying voice of opposition to [Root.GetNeutralParty]!"
 BALTIC_concessions_for_catholics:0 "Concessions for Catholics"
 BALTIC_concessions_for_catholics_desc:0 "Much of [Root.GetNameDef]’s lower classes are devout Catholics, and in the first Worker’s Republic, religious practice was harshly stamped out by the Red Army. This turned many of [Root.GetNameDef]’s poor against the revolution, so if we are to truly be the republic of the people, we must assure them in no uncertain terms that their faith will be protected."
 BALTIC_secure_military_support:0 "Secure Military Support"
 BALTIC_secure_military_support_desc:0 "Many in the military would seek to rid the nation of [Root.GetLeader], all we need do is approach them. A general seeking honour and renown would surely be drawn to our cause with the promise of becoming a hero of the people."
 BALTIC_overthrow_the_government:0 "Overthrow [Root.GetNeutralParty]"
 BALTIC_overthrow_the_government_desc:0 "We have gathered enough support to topple [Root.GetLeader] and [Root.GetLeader.GetHerHis] regime! All we need do is march on the capital and proclaim a new Worker’s Republic!"
 BALTIC_sieze_the_means_of_production:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
 BALTIC_sieze_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "The old government invited investors from overseas to exploit the labour of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. We cannot continue to allow the hands of the proletariat to serve their foreign bourgeoisie masters and all factories constructed by these multinational corporations must be taken into the custody of [Root.GetNameDef]."
 BALTIC_revolutionary_cabinet:0 "A Revolutionary Cabinet"
 BALTIC_revolutionary_cabinet_desc:0 "Now that we have returned to our rightful place as the stalwart sentinels of the lower-class, we may once again assemble a cabinet of ministers aligned with the ideology of our new state."
 BALTIC_direct_intervention:0 "Direct Soviet Intervention"
 BALTIC_direct_intervention_desc:0 "We have proven unable to reclaim the government alone and we must call upon our allies in [SOV.GetNameDef] to aid us in our struggle."
 BALTIC_squash_resistance:0 "Squash All Resistance"
 BALTIC_squash_resistance_desc:0 "There are still yet people who believe socialism to be the enemy of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty, and these people must be rooted out if we are to advance the revolution."
 BALTIC_purge_of_our_own:0 "A Purge of Our Own"
 BALTIC_purge_of_our_own_desc:0 "Even through our best efforts to squash all resistance, there are still those organizing in the shadows, conspiring against the proletariat to restore a capitalist dictatorship in [Root.GetNonIdeologyName]. We must conduct a popular purge; rooting out any members of the old government and any who support them."
 BALTIC_crush_forest_brothers:0 "Crush the Forest Brothers"
 BALTIC_crush_forest_brothers_desc:0 "The Forest Brothers have been a blight on our nation since our takeover; sabotaging our industries, railroads, and disrupting official government demonstrations. We must venture into the forests of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] and root out these misguided individuals."
 BALTIC_red_army:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Red Riflemen"
 BALTIC_red_army_desc:0 "Our army must be made up of only those willing to defend socialism within [Root.GetNameDef] and spread it amongst the populace of the world, and this may only be achieved by restoring the [Root.GetAdjective] Red Riflemen."
 BALTIC_align_paramilitarists:0 "Realign the Paramilitarists"
 BALTIC_align_paramilitarists_desc:0 "There are many paramilitary groups throughout [Root.GetNameDef], most of which are devoted solely to the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] self-determination. While admirable, it would be preferred if these groups were to see us not as [SOV.GetAdjective] puppets, but as the logical continuation of the [Root.GetAdjective] state."
 BALTIC_influence_neighbours:0 "Influence the Neighbours"
 BALTIC_influence_neighbours_desc:0 "Although not nearly as popular as it was before the wars of independence, the concept of a freed Baltic under socialism is as old as the concept of Baltic self-determination itself. Our state can stand as something to be modelled by those living under the oppressive regimes of the Baltic dictatorships and by weaponizing that, we stand to spread the Revolution to our neighbours bloodlessly."
 BALTIC_arm_baltic_reds:0 "Arm Baltic Reds"
 BALTIC_arm_baltic_reds_desc:0 "The stage is set, communist fervor is burning all across the Baltics. All the reds need now is the signal and resources from us and we will spark the Baltic revolution!"
 BALTIC_belarus_ssr:0 "[Root.GetNonIdeologyName]-Belarus SSR"
 BALTIC_belarus_ssr_desc:0 "The concept of uniting Belarus and the Baltic is not a foreign one. Long ago the Lithuanian-Belarus Soviet Socialist Republic existed as a harmonious fusion of these two seemingly different peoples. Socialism knows no boundaries of culture and language, and we see little reason why [Root.GetAdjective] and Belorussian workers could not co-exist."
 BALTIC_end_bourgeouis_dictatorships:0 "End the Bourgeoisie Dictatorships"
 BALTIC_end_bourgeouis_dictatorships_desc:0 "The Baltics are dominated by so-called “neutral” dictators. With the backing of the military and without consent of their people, the proletariat of the Baltic are oppressed under capitalist dictatorship. It is only by the hands of freed [Root.GetAdjective] workers that these workers kept separate by unjust borders may share in our glorious liberation!"
 BALTIC_focus_on_the_interior:0 "Focus on the Interior"
 BALTIC_focus_on_the_interior_desc:0 "Though many workers are eager to march on our neighbours and bring our glorious revolution to all Baltic peoples, we must instead focus on the interior of our nation; stabilizing the regime following the revolution."
 BALTIC_focus_on_the_interior_2:0 "Prepare for the Germans"
 BALTIC_focus_on_the_interior_2_desc:0 "It is vital that we do not forget the absolute brutality that the Freikorps brought to [Root.GetNameDef] so many years ago. Peasants and workers were butchered as if animals, entire villages reduced to ash and ruin, and we cannot allow the [Root.GetAdjective] people to ever endure such brutality again."
