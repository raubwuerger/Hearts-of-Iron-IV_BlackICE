 sweden.19.d:0 "Following the announcement of the new Åland policy, unofficial allegiances seem to have formed in the last months across party lines. In turn many MP's have chosen to challenge parts of the Government which has led to several altercations. This has led Prime Minister Hansson to get involved in the situation.

 sweden.105.t:0 "Operation Stella Polaris"
 sweden.105.d:0 "As the war is not necessarily going in our favor, some intelligence officers have suggested we move our encryption and decryption equipment along with our most important officers to Sweden.

The operation will be codenamed Stella Polaris where we will help them to ship everything across the Gulf of Bothnia."

Furthermore the demilitarization of the territory was essential if it should pass in the League of Nations. The Swedes have now decided to reclaim Åland as part of their territory. Given the large Swedish population on the Islands this is hardly surprising,  many Generals and Politicians have pushed for this since the Convention was signed.
