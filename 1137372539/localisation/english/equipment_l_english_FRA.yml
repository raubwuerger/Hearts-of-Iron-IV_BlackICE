This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Strasbourg Class BC"
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Strasbourg class was the successor of the Dunkerque-class with a higher amor protection and hull improvements to counter the German Scharnhorst and pocket battleship designs of the German Kriegsmarine. Its high range allowed it to follow the German surface raider into the Atlantic Ocean for a final gun fight."
 FRA_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class BB"
 FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 FRA_battleship_1b:0 "Paris Class BB"
 FRA_battleship_2:0 "Bretagne Class BB"
 FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Bretagne-class battleships were the first \"super-dreadnoughts\" built for the French Navy during the First World War. The class comprised three vessels: Bretagne, the lead ship, Provence, and Lorraine. They were an improvement of the previous Courbet class, and mounted ten 340 mm (13.4 in) guns instead of twelve 305 mm (12 in) guns as on the Courbets.	Armor protection and firepower were state of the art at that time but it cannot compete against newer battleship designs, therefore the ships were held in reserve during WW2."
 FRA_battleship_2b:0 "Lorraine Class BB"
 FRA_battleship_2b_desc:0 "The Lorraine-class is the upgraded and re-constructed design of the former Bretagne-class battleships. The ships got an facelifte during the 1920s were the armor protection was significantly reduced in order to free up space for additional four 450 mm (18 in) torpedo tubes. These change would allow the battleship leave the battle line to close onto enemy battleships firing deadly torpedos at it."
 FRA_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class BB"
 FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class BB (380mm)"
 FRA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_battleship_4b:0 "Alsace type Class BB (406mm)"
 FRA_battleship_4b_desc:0 "This was the second design of the Alsace-class battleship with a slightly increased main battery armament. The rest of the battleships desgin remained the same."
 FRA_fast_battleship_1:0 "Richelieu Class Fast-BB"
 FRA_fast_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_fast_battleship_2:0 "Jean Bart Class Fast-BB"
 FRA_fast_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Jean Bart class battleships were one of the design choices branched off from the former Richelieu-class. While firepower, armor protection and speed was kept, the anti aircraft armament was significantly increased and the design came close to one of the first anti-aircraft platform battleships ready to conquer the newest Italian battleships as well as the rising threat of naval aviation."
 FRA_fast_battleship_3:0 "Clemenceau Class Fast-BB"
 FRA_fast_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Clemencaue class was another successor based on the famous Richelieu class. This design had a higher top speed of 32 knots and its hull design and inner compartments were strengthed resulting in a more reliable battleship with reduced risk to suffer critical hits during battles."
 FRA_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class CV"
 FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class CV"
 FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_seaplane_tender_1:0 "Commadant Teste Class AV"
 FRA_seaplane_tender_1_desc:0 "The Commandant Teste was a large seaplane tender of the French Navy. After the completion of aircraft carrier Béarn, the Marine Nationale desired another aviation vessel, but the lack of another hull that could cheaply be converted made another aircraft carrier too expensive. It settled for a seaplane carrier (French: transport d'aviation) that could act as a mobile aviation base and support seaplanes for a specific attack. The ship was restricted to a maximum size of 10,000 t (9,800 long tons) at standard displacement. It could carry up to 26 seaplanes and had four catapults and recovery cranse making them a ideal addition to the french naval forces."
 FRA_seaplane_tender_2:0 "Sans Souci Class AV"
 FRA_seaplane_tender_2_desc:0 "The Sans Souci class was a much smaller seaplane tender design as the previous Commandant Teste class. It could carry only six seaplanes but was much faster to produce. The class was supposed to function as reconnaisance and support ship for the Marine Nationale. It featured a slow speed of just 16.7 knots and dsiplaced not more than 1.800 long tons."
