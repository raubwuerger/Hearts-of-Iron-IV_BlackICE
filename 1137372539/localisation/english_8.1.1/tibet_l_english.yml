The Lamaist State has series of unprecendented democratic reforms in order to open to the modern world and give the country modern institutions while their next ruler, the Dalai Lama, is too young to rule personally. The treaty that was negotiated by the British Mission in Lhasa during the previous months was partially modeled on the treaty of Punakha signed in 1910 between British India and the Royal dynasty of Bhutan. This new treaty shows the determination of the British Government to protect its interests in India, a subject that is more important than ever as China has been in a state of chronic instability since the revolution of 1912."

 himalaya_tibet.9.desc:0 "Two and a half years ago, the previous Dalai Lama passed away. After each death, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated somewhere as a Tibetan. Therefore the search of the Dalai Lama is the most important task of the Regency Government in order to ensure the continuity of the theocratic system. The Regent just convened the Tibetan National Assembly to decide where to search for the Dalai Lama. In this process two elements were essential: signs and omens would give the governments general informations on where to look for. Then the visions of the Regent would give more precise informations on the location of the next Dalai Lama. He explained that last year, while he was at lake Lhamolatso, he saw the letters \"a\", \"ka\" and \"ma\", a monastery with three-tiered turquoise roof, a gilded pagoda-like top and a twisting trail leading east of this monastery to a bare hill opposite a small one story house with a blue roof. A should mean Amdo (the former Tibetan province in the north-east). This is consistent with the fact that the head of the Dalai Lama turned east after his death. In addition, on the east side of a wooden pillar located in the northeast side of the throneroom, a great star-shaped fungus appeared overnight. In addition, on several different occasions the state oracles Nechung, Gadong, and Samye had flung ceremonial scarves toward the east while in trance. \n\nWhile a part of the assembly is convinced that searching parties must be sent to Amdo, currently under the control of Hui warlords, some, lead by Lönchen Langdün argued that one of his relative, the son of Yabshi Phawpön is the Dalai Lama because one of the horses of the stable of the previous Dalai Lama broke loose and ran to his house, as if he was waiting his master."

It was one of only 17 houses, a rectangular, ground-level building, with its various parts arranged around a wide central courtyard and a rectangular flat roof. There were no openings on the outside walls, except for the doorway. On the roof, there were three chimneys stacks and two air-holes. Around the roof were small gutters with spouts giving out into the courtyard. Over the entrance, there was a socket fixed in the roof to take a 10-foot-high flagpole. \n\nThe search party came there because of the letter \"a\" seen by the Reting Rinpoche in his vision was referring to the province of Amdo, the letter \"ka\" certainly meant the monastery of Kumbum. That building was three stories high and roofed by blue tiles, as described by the Regent. The last part of the vision indicated a house with a peculiar tree. Here, finally, they saw a house with a gnarling juniper bush on the flat roof...\n\nIn order to investigate, Kewtsang Rinpoche who was leading the party, disguised himself as a servant while they asked to stay for the night. In it live a couple of peasants and their children, the first one was living at the Kumbum monastery as he had been recognized as the reincarnation of the Taktser Rinpoche. One of those children suddenly recognized him and called him \"Sera Lama\" multiple times, as if he knew his monastery. A few days later they came back with some of the objects brought from Lhasa and he recognized those belonging to the previous Dalai Lama. The party then left for Kumbum, bringing with them the latest incarnation of Avalokiteśvara."

In order to allow the boy to leave their walls, they want us to recognize him as the Dalai Lama right here rather than in Lhasa. This is dangerous as it would logically increase the diplomatic value of what is still officially a little boy and it would in a certain way recognize that Tibet is dependent on China, something that nobody want in Tibet. In order to abandon those demands, they asked us to cede a number of artifacts: samples of the wardrobe of the previous Dalai Lama, one of his thrones, a copy of the Kangyur (saying of the Buddha in 108 volumes) written in golden letters and a copy of the Tengyur, the Tibetan translation of the commentary of the Indian sages."
