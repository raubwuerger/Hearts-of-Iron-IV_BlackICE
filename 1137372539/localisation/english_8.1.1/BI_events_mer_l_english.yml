In spite of the danger, countless Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland.

 mandate.10.d:0 "The Arab community in Palestine is on strike! They are demanding changes in the Mandate’s policies, namely limiting Jewish immigration and limiting the purchase of Arab land by Jews.

 mandate.11.t:0 "The Peel Commission"
 mandate.11.d:0 "Following the Arab General Strike and increasing violence in Palestine, the British have sent Lord Peel to investigate the causes of the strike as well as the motives of the conflicting Arabs and Jews in the Mandate.

 mandate.12.t:0 "The Peel Commission Publishes its Report"
 mandate.12.d:0 "After a year of review, the Peel Commission has concluded. Its report does not bode well. The commission has determined that “An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab Golden Age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State.” Strikes and revolts have resumed as both Arab and Jewish militias work to better arm themselves for the coming fight."

Meanwhile, the Arab leadership, contrary to our expectations, is split on the issue. Amin al-Husayni is the only major supporter from the Arab High Committee of this new policy. The League of Nations has also refused to offer its support"
 mandate.13.a:0 "This is our new policy."

 mandate.14.t:0 "Special Night Squads"
 mandate.14.d:0 "As our need for Special Forces grows, so does Orde Wingate’s desire to experiment with new tactics.

 bmpisrael.3.t:0 "The Altalena Affair"
 bmpisrael.3.d:0 "Our government has worked hard to turn the many paramilitary organizations into the Israeli Defense Force. While the Irgun has resisted our efforts, until now, they have been fighting alongside the IDF. However, after their doomed efforts to use the Altalena to smuggle in French weapons for their fighters, and the uproar caused by the killing of Irgun members by the IDF in a dispute over these weapons, it is clear we can no longer allow a rogue army to function and make deals with foreign powers from within our borders."
 bmpisrael.3.a:0 "We should send them an ultimatum, “Join us or be destroyed.”"
