 franceBiceE.00.t:0 "1936 Election: Unions go on Strike!"
 franceBiceE.00.d:0 "During the 1936 elections, a massive strike was organized by nearly all French labor unions. The strike was intended to put pressure on the government to quickly pass social reforms. The strike was largely successful, resulting in the Matignon Agreements which made gigantic concessions to the unions. After the passage of the reforms, the strikes ended."
 franceBiceE.00.a:0 "This could topple the government! STARTS CRISIS"
 franceBiceE.01.t:0 "Form a Coalition with the Conservatives"
 franceBiceE.01.d:0 "Forming a coalition government with the communists is rash and unnecessary. With tensions escalating with powers abroad and political instability at home, we can’t afford to experiment with new types of government now."
 franceBiceE.01.a:0 "We shall seek to form a stable government."
 franceBiceE.02.t:0 "Electoral Gridlock in France"
 franceBiceE.02.d:0 "The election is over, and the triumphant socialists have failed to form a government. With France’s future uncertain, radical groups are seizing the opportunity to cause chaos and press forward their agendas. The already crushing union strikes are intensifying as workers all over the country band together to demand reform, the far-right is calling for blood, and the Soviets are eyeing France as ripe for revolution.\n\nOur government is falling apart at the seams. However, before we are pushed from power, we have the opportunity to throw our support behind one of these radical groups. In essence, we can play kingmaker – choosing to support the far-right leagues, or the communists. We must quickly make a stand before the political violence escalates into civil war!"
 franceBiceE.02.a:0 "This is the end of the Third Republic..."
 franceBiceE.03.t:0 "Communists Demand Spanish Intervention"
 franceBiceE.03.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War is not going well for the Republicans. From the outbreak of the conflict, the communists have argued for intervention, but [FRA.GetLeader] has always pushed for neutrality. Now the issue has come to a head – the communists are threatening to pull their support from the Government if we do not do something to help the Spanish Republicans.\n\nThe communists control enough of the government that if they abandon us, it will cause our government to collapse. However, if we do intervene, it will deeply upset our allies and potentially cause an all-out war with Germany and Italy. If we intervene in Spain and Germany declares war on us, we might have to fight them alone."
 franceBiceE.03.a:0 "We cannot ignore the Spanish any longer! STARTS CRISIS"
 franceBiceE.04.t:0 "A Great Power in Name Only"
 franceBiceE.04.d:0 "France is not what she used to be. The Great War has left deep scars on our county that have yet to fully heal. Hitler’s Germany is now outcompeting us in nearly every category - Their economy is double our own and is growing rapidly, they also have double our manpower reserves, and their weapons are more advanced than our own.\n\nOur Grande Armee is still one of the best in Europe, but it is quickly being eclipsed by the rising power of Germany. Most of our equipment is leftover from the Great War and our nation lacks modern tanks. Our Airforce is sizeable, but entirely obsolete - most of our planes are old biplanes from decades past. Our efforts to design and build modern aircraft have thus far been laughably unsuccessful. Our Navy, once considered one of the best in the world, is now second-rate at best. We are currently completely reliant on Britain’s Royal Navy in the case that a war breaks out.\n\nOur nation may look strong on paper, but in practice we are dangerously weak. We must navigate the oncoming political crises and rearm our nation as best we can with the time we have left."
 franceBiceE.04.a:0 "Nonsense! Surely our nation isn't that weak!"
 franceBiceE.05.t:0 "Tensions Rise as the 1936 Election Approaches"
 franceBiceE.05.d:0 "As the 1936 Legislative Elections draw near, tensions are rapidly rising amongst the major French political factions. The Communists are radicalizing the factory workers and union members who have long been suffering under our stagnant economy. The Fascists in the Far-Right Leagues are becoming more violent, inflicting terror in the population.\n\nThe support for the radicals has reached a breaking point. The Socialists and Communists have banded together and will almost certainly win the upcoming election unless drastic action is taken. In the upcoming chaos, Fascists groups will also be looking for their opportunity to strike. If we are not extremely careful, this could be the end of democracy in France."
 franceBiceE.05.a:0 "Vive la République!"
 franceBiceE.06.t:0 "France Demands that All Nations Embargo Germany"
 franceBiceE.06.d:0 "France is attempting to starve Germany of strategic resources. To that end, France is demanding that all European nations that are still conducting trade with Germany embargo them immediately. This would stop all trade with Germany, massively angering the Reich and may even give Germany a reason to declare war on us. Refusing might upset France. It looks like will need to choose a side sooner rather than later."
 franceBiceE.06.a:0 "Accept: Embargo Germany and her allies."
 franceBiceE.06.b:0 "Refuse: Our trade with Germany is far too valuable."
 franceBiceE.07.t:0 "[From.GetName] Stops all Trade with Germany"

 franceBiceE.08.a:0 "Disappointing."
 franceBiceE.09.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
 franceBiceE.09.d:0 "France has sent an ultimatum to us demanding that we stop all trade with Germany or France will declare war on us. Time has run out, we must choose a side."
 franceBiceE.09.a:0 "Refuse: We stand with Germany."
 franceBiceE.09.b:0 "Accept: Embargo Germany and her allies."

 franceBiceE.12.d:0 "France has decided to leave us out of their war. We are free to trade with whomever we please."
 franceBiceE.12.a:0 "Pathetic."
 franceBiceE.13.t:0 "France Asks for Help in Spain"
 franceBiceE.13.d:0 "France has chosen to intervene in Spain, and they are asking us for aid. The British public are vehemently opposed to war of any kind and helping the Spanish Republicans might drag our nation into a larger world conflict if we are not careful. Right now, France is only asking for guns and supplies to help arm the Spanish Republicans.\n\nHowever, if we help France now, they will almost certainly come back later asking us for more help – perhaps asking for us to join their war in Spain. We should treat France’s request for aid with caution, as things could quickly spiral out of control. If we are not careful, our intervention could be the spark that ignites the world in another Great War."
 franceBiceE.13.a:0 "We can spare some equipment for the Spanish Republicans."
 franceBiceE.13.b:0 "France can handle Spain on their own."
 franceBiceE.14.t:0 "Britian Agrees to Donate Equipment"
 franceBiceE.14.d:0 "The British have agreed to help the Spanish fight for democracy."
 franceBiceE.14.a:0 "For democracy!"
 franceBiceE.15.t:0 "Britian Refuses to Aid the Spanish"
 franceBiceE.15.d:0 "The British have refused to intervene in the Spanish Civil War."
 franceBiceE.15.a:0 "Disappointing."
 franceBiceE.16.t:0 "France Asks for British Intervention in Spain"
 franceBiceE.16.d:0 "France has chosen to intervene in Spain, and they are asking us for aid. The British public are vehemently opposed to war of any kind and helping the Spanish Republicans might drag our nation into a larger world conflict if we are not careful. The other fascist powers in Europe, such as Germany and Italy have already intervened in Spain and tensions are rising rapidly.\n\nIf we intervene, Germany and the other fascist powers in Europe might declare war on France and us. Our rearmament programmes are still not complete, and if we were to go to war right now, it could be disastrous. We must carefully consider France’s offer; while they are our friend, their brash actions in Spain could lead to another World War."
 franceBiceE.16.a:0 "We will stand with France against fascism!"
 franceBiceE.16.b:0 "We cannot risk starting another Great War!"
 franceBiceE.17.t:0 "The Last Strikes are Broken"
 franceBiceE.17.d:0 "The union strikers have been crushed. While the radical Far Right Leagues have certain benefited from these decisions, they are not real threat to us anymore. France is free from radical political parties for now and we can all finally get back to work."
 franceBiceE.17.a:0 "At last, things can return to normal."
 franceBiceE.18.t:0 "Officially Recognize the Spanish State"
 franceBiceE.18.d:0 "We may not like it, but the Spanish people must decide their own future. The Republicans are all but beaten already. Germany and Italy have thrown their support behind Fascist Spain and if we intervened now it would certainly cause an all-out war. We must buy more time to rearm our military! We will come back and confront Germany and Italy, but only once we have an army that will strike terror into them."
 franceBiceE.18.a:0 "This is the New Spain."
 franceBiceE.19.t:0 "Inspire Spanish Democracy"
 franceBiceE.19.d:0 "We have given the Spanish people the tools they need to forge their own future. If there is a will, there is a way. Now we just need to make sure the Spaniards choose the correct way. After giving the Republicans massive amounts of aid for their civil war, we can demand that they keep communists out of their government and that they keep a safe distance away from the Soviets."
 franceBiceE.19.a:0 "The Spaniards will choose their own destiny."
 franceBiceE.20.t:0 "Turn Spain Into Our Puppet"
 franceBiceE.20.d:0 "The Republican's performance during the Spanish Civil War does not inspire confidence. Even if we help them win their war, their government might just collapse anyways. Level heads are needed to rebuild Spain, and we are up to the task. The Spanish and British might not be happy with our decision, but drastic measures are needed to keep Spain from devolving into complete chaos and fascism.\n\nAny one-sided benefits we may or may not get from this arrangement are purely coincidental."
 franceBiceE.20.a:0 "Yes... Purely coincidental..."
 franceBiceE.21.t:0 "Inflation Gets Worse"
 franceBiceE.21.d:0 "Over the past few months, inflation has gotten worse. Wages have become stagnant, food is becoming expensive, and the French people are losing patience with the government. The French people are remembering with horror the effects that hyperinflation had on Germany. German people needed literal wheelbarrows of money to buy a loaf of bread and they used stacks of money for firewood.\n\nWe must do whatever we can do avoid the same fate as Germany – if we do not act soon it could lead to a total economic crisis!"
 franceBiceE.21.a:0 "If we do not act soon, our economy could collapse!"
 franceBiceE.22.t:0 "Inflation Reaches Critical Levels"
 franceBiceE.22.d:0 "Our worst fears have come to pass, inflation has reached a critical level. If we do not take drastic actions right now the economy will collapse. Our citizens our watching in horror as years of hard work are evaporating in front of them. Soaring prices have completely eclipsed the wages of most workers, more and more people are unable to afford food and housing, and we will soon be unable to afford to support our growing military.\n\nWe have no choice but to take immediate action, everything else must be put on hold until we deal with this crisis!"
 franceBiceE.22.a:0 "Our economy is on the brink of collapse! STARTS CRISIS"
 franceBiceE.23.t:0 "Free France Demands Our Support"
 franceBiceE.23.d:0 "After France's defeat, some resistance fighters fled to Africa vowing to continue the fight. They are both few in number and lack good equipment, their resistance looks rather pathetic at the moment. Yet Degualle and the Free French are still asking for our support. Should we remain loyal to Vichy or take a chance on Degualle and continue the fight?"
 franceBiceE.23.a:0 "Remain Loyal to Vichy"

 franceBiceE.27.d:0 "Ever since Degualle starting spouting his traitorous rhetoric from Africa, many in the Army and Navy have sympethized with him. Now many sailors in the Navy are begining to whisper about defecting to this 'Free France' and abondoning their oaths of loyalty to us! Should we allow this to happen?"
 franceBiceE.27.a:0 "Keep the Navy Loyal to us."
 franceBiceE.27.b:0 "Let the Navy join Degualle."
 franceBiceE.28.t:0 "The Navy Remains Loyal to Vichy"

 franceBiceE.28.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 franceBiceE.29.t:0 "The Navy Joins Free France!"
 franceBiceE.29.d:0 "The brave sailors of the French Navy have found their courage and have decided to join our cause. However, we now have the problem of fueling these ships and finding safe harbor for them. Germany will now surely attack the ships now that they have defected to us, so we must move quickly!"
 franceBiceE.29.a:0 "Fantastic News! GERMANY WILL NOW ATTACK THESE SHIPS!"
 franceBiceE.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Defected to Free France"

 franceBiceE.31.d:0 "The Army of Africa has abondoned the false puppet state of Vichy and decided to join our fight against our occupiers!

 franceBiceE.40.t:0 "French Intervention in Spain"
 franceBiceE.40.d:0 "France has decided to fully commit itself to the Spanish Civil War. This gives us a rather unique opportunity to strike at France while their attention is directed south. However, our nation isn’t yet fully ready for all-out war. It might be wiser to bide our time and continue to rebuild our military.\n\nIf we declare war on France now, there are several nations in Eastern Europe such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania that might join France and declare war on us." 
 franceBiceE.40.a:0 "Declare war on France!"
 franceBiceE.40.b:0 "We are not yet ready."
 franceBiceE.41.t:0 "France Calls the Little Entente to War Against Germany!"
 franceBiceE.41.d:0 "In 1921, our nation helped to create the Little Entente Alliance against Germany, Hungary, and Austria. While this “alliance” was mostly a diplomatic formality, France has found herself yet again at war with Germany and has asked for our aid.\n\nSince this alliance was never fully realized, we are under no obligation to join the war against Germany and send our people to die in another Great War. However, it is clear the Germany intends to rebuild its military. Once that happens, we will be at their mercy. Helping France to crush Germany now might save our nation in the future."

It is unclear whether the leaders of Yugoslavia, Romania, and Poland will join France in this war against Germany, but what is clear is that most European leaders seem to believe that this war will escalate further.\n   Germany has issued stern warnings to all concerned nations to stay out of this conflict or face the harshest of repercussions.\n   We estimate that it will take French diplomats about two weeks to finalize agreements with the concerned nations."

 sweden.60.a:0 "Establish the Union"
 sweden.60.b:0 "No, we shall retain our Independence"
 sweden.61.t:0 "The Norwegians Refuse"
 sweden.61.d:0 "The Norwegians refuse to join in a union with us, this is very sad indeed but they reassure us that we have a good friend in Scandinavia."
 sweden.61.a:0 "A sad day for us"
 sweden.65.t:0 "A Deal with Sweden"
 sweden.65.d:0 "The Swedes have chosen to offer us a Deal out of the Socialist camaraderie  which bind our two nations together. They offer us the former Finnish State of Karalia in return for a membership in the Comintern and our help in undermining the Norwegian Government to promote the Communist Ideology. This is a generous offer, should we take it?"
 sweden.65.a:0 "Accept the offer"
 sweden.65.b:0 "Refuse the offer"
 sweden.66.t:0 "The Soviets refuse our Offer!"
 sweden.66.d:0 "The Soviets have decided that our deal is not desirable to them at the present time. We will have to do without them."

 sweden.70.t:0 "The King Summons the Government"
 sweden.70.d:0 "The King Gustaf the V has decided to summon the Government. He is concerned with the political course our Country has taken and is very skeptical of the Coalition Government with the NSAP. As the King still holds significant political power he is thinking of supporting the SAP publicly. We must prevent this! Fortunately he despises the Communists more than us."
 sweden.70.a:0 "Convince the King of the Communist threat!"
 sweden.70.b:0 "Let the old Fool be."
 sweden.72.t:0 "Royalist Newspapers"
 sweden.72.d:0 "It seems the exiled King Gustaf the V has for some time been fabricating stories about us and our politicians in so called royalist newspapers. These have been printed in neighboring countries and distributed in secret. This has bread some discontent amongst the populous. What should we do?"
 sweden.72.a:0 "Let the T-Office arrest the distributors!"
 sweden.72.b:0 "We can't counteract this."
 sweden.75.t:0 "Unite with Finland-Swedes"
 sweden.75.d:0 "As we have liberated our people and taken rightful control of our historic territories, many Swedish minority or in some areas even majority populations could be put to better use. By letting loyal nationalists take place in their institutions we can make the states of Åland and Pohjanmaa into core-states, should we?"

 sweden.75.b:0 "Too much effort, do nothing."
 sweden.90.t:0 "Return of the King"
 sweden.90.d:0 "The military leadership together with a strong activist public opinion have succeeded in their efforts to rally support for Finland and enter into an Alliance with them at the Åbo Conference. It is no secret that the Government under Per Albin Hansson have been opposed to this policy. As doubts about their intentions to honor this Alliance have come forward, a crisis inside the Government has unfolded. On behalf of several Generals the King has decided to step forward and is prepared to head a Council consisting of prominent Members of Parliament to stabilize the Government and continue the Constitutional Monarchy."

 sweden.90.b:0 "Never, we must retain our Democracy!"

 sweden.100.d:0 "The Swedish head of state Gustaf V has asked the heads of state of Norway, Denmark and Finland to a meeting in Stockholm to discuss the political and economic challenges that lie ahead in a more uncertain Europe. The main point of discussion will be a changed geopolitical environment and how the Nordic countries will declare themselves in the troubles to come. This conference will boost relations between the Scandinavian countries and perhaps serve as a foundation for future cooperation."
 sweden.100.a:0 "Attend the Conference"
 sweden.100.b:0 "No, this is not in our intrest"
 sweden.105.t:0 "Operation Stella Polaris"
 sweden.105.d:0 "As the war is not necessarily going in our favor, some intelligence officers have suggested we move our encryption and decryption equipment along with our most important officers to Sweden.

 sweden.105.a:0 "Send them to Sweden"
 sweden.105.b:0 "They are needed here!"
 sweden.106.t:0 "Operation Stella Polaris"

This will mean that we get our hands on valuable information, skilled intelligence officers and equipment. The operation will be codenamed Stella Polaris where we will help them to ship everything across the Gulf of Bothnia."
 sweden.106.a:0 "Perform the Operation"
 sweden.106.b:0 "No, this is too risky"
