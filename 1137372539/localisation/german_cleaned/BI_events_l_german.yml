The italian tricolore was raised, cheers erupted amongst the soldiers and a clean up operation within Addis Ababa was immediately started.\n In Rome, Mussolini spoke to an enormous crowd on the Piazza Venezia, in throngs gathered around loud-speakers in every village square in Italy and the message was clear: The world has got its first taste of Italian military power - and it shall not be the last!"

 worldnews.8.d:0	"Bombshell Nobel Prize Award Ceremony In a decision that overshadowed all other decisions, the Nobel Prize Committee decided to retroactively award the Nobel Peace Prize 1935, which was not awarded last year, to Carl von Ossietzky. If ever a man worked, fought & suffered for Peace, it is the sickly little German, Carl von Ossietzky. For nearly a year the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has been swamped with petitions from all shades of Socialists, Liberals and literary folk generally, nominating Carl von Ossietzky for the 1935 Peace Prize. Their slogan: 'Send the Peace Prize into the Prison Camp.'\nThe Nobel Peace Prize for 1936 has been awarded to Mr. Carlos Saavedra Lamas, foreign minister of the Argentine Republic. The prize has thus been given to a statesman. It must be recognized that the principles underlying Saavedra Lamas’ Antiwar Pact have stood a practical test on South American soil and under his personal leadership. In making this statement, Saavedra Lamas has set a task for the future. He is still a man in the prime of life. His recent achievements in the politics of peace entitle us to hope that his unusual energy and singleness of purpose will enable him to contribute even more to the creation of a truly lasting peace between nations. \nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1936 was awarded jointly to Sir Henry Hallett Dale and Otto Loewi 'for their discoveries relating to chemical transmission of nerve impulses.' \nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1936 was awarded to Petrus (Peter) Josephus Wilhelmus Debye 'for his contributions to our knowledge of molecular structure through his investigations on dipole moments and on the diffraction of X-rays and electrons in gases'.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1936 was awarded to Eugene Gladstone O'Neill 'for the power, honesty and deep-felt emotions of his dramatic works, which embody an original concept of tragedy.'\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1936 was divided equally between Victor Franz Hess 'for his discovery of cosmic radiation' and Carl David Anderson 'for his discovery of the positron.'"

 worldnews.9.d:0	"Foremost Defender of the League of Nations\n The Nobel Prize Committee today awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the British politician, diplomat and peace activist Lord Robert Cecil.\n During World War I he was Minister of Blockade, and at the Versailles peace conference he played a leading part in the formulation of the rules of the League of Nations. In 1919 he participated in the founding of the League of Nations Union (LNU), which in the inter-war years became Britain's most important extra-parliamentary pressure group in the field of foreign policy.\n In 1937 Lord Cecil spearheaded a nationwide signature campaign demanding that the League of Nations adopt economic and military penal sanctions against violators of the peace. He was also among the leaders of the International Peace Campaign (IPC), which worked for disarmament and collective security through the League of Nations.\n The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 was awarded to Albert von Szent-Györgyi Nagyrápolt 'for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion processes, with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid.'\n The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1937 was divided equally between Walter Norman Haworth 'for his investigations on carbohydrates and vitamin C' and Paul Karrer 'for his investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2.'\n The Nobel Prize in Literature 1937 was awarded to Roger Martin du Gard 'for the artistic power and truth with which he has depicted human conflict as well as some fundamental aspects of contemporary life in his novel-cycle Les Thibault.'\n The Nobel Prize in Physics 1937 was awarded jointly to Clinton Joseph Davisson and George Paget Thomson 'for their experimental discovery of the diffraction of electrons by crystals.' \n On another note, Adolf Hitler, chancellor of Germany, issued a decree that essentially forbids German nationals to accept any Nobel Prize. While this year sees no German honorees, one might wonder whatever might happen, should that change in the years to come."

Swedish King Gustav V presented the Laureates with their Nobel Diplomas and Medals.\n The Nobel Peace Prize 1938 was awarded to Office international Nansen pour les Réfugiés (Nansen International Office for Refugees).\n The Nobel Prize in Physics 1938 was awarded to Enrico Fermi 'for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons.' After receiving the prize in Stockholm, Fermi opted to not return to Italy (whispers are this happened due to the new racial laws in Italy that threaten his Jewish wife) and instead continued to New York City. Apparently he applied for permanent residency there, making Italian officials fume with rage, calling Fermi a traitor.\n The Nobel Prize in Literature 1938 was awarded to Pearl Buck 'for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces.'\n The committee withheld both the prizes for Chemistry as well as Physiology or Medicine, stating none of the year’s nominations met the criteria outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel."

The offense first was concentrated on Nanyuan barracks, with a secondary attack on Beiyuan north of Beijing. Soldiers from both sides fought with great determination and positions changed hands several times. \nIn the end, the outcome was severely altered by Chinese traitor Yuguio Pan, who relayed Chinese troop deployment and plans for a counter-offensive to the Japanese. With an ambush near Tuanhe, the Japanese managed to destroy numerous Chinese regiments. \nThe Nanyuan barracks was surrounded by a brick wall, and the first line of Chinese defense was set right outside it. At dawn, Japanese artillery turned the brick wall into debris and soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, CGA 1st Infantry Regiment under the command of Ichiki charged into the weakest spot of the Chinese line, where student soldiers were positioned. \nThe regiment included 1,700 students from local universities and high schools, who were receiving military training at the time. Mostly teenagers, they had been given their rifles a few hours earlier. The Japanese, thinking that they could capture the barracks easily, were greatly surprised by their opponents’ dogged determination later in the fight. \nAs the Japanese poured into Chinese trenches, a hand-to-hand melee broke out between the opposing forces. The students fought desperately but were no match for the Japanese soldiers, who were masters of close combat. Although the Chinese managed to hold their positions with great determination, the cost was devastating. The student-soldiers lost 10 of their number for every Japanese soldier killed or wounded. The tremendous sacrifice of the Chinese students stopped the Japanese only for a few hours. \nWith the stronghold of Nanyuan lost, General Song acknowledged that the battle was as good as lost and any further resistance would be futile. The Generalissimo also noted the gravity of the situation and ordered Song to withdraw. By nightfall, Song abandoned Beiping and withdrew the bulk of his army to Baoding."

The meeting marked the radicalisation of Hitler's foreign policies. \n\n Hitler began his remarks by stating that the goal of German politics must be to respond to Germany's	"shortage of space". Since it was not possible for Germany to be self-sufficiently supplied with its present territory, and considering that the German economy should not make itself dependent on foreign trade, an expansion of German territory was inevitable. In doing so, Germany would have to arm itself against Bolshevism as well as against the	"hate opponents" England and France. \nThe goal of German policy is to secure and preserve the masses of the people and to increase their numbers. Thus, it was a problem of territory. To solve the German question there can only be the way of violence, which will never be without risk. If one places the decision to use violence under risk at the head of the following explanations, then the questions 'when' and 'how' remain to be answered. \nIn order to improve our military-political situation, our first goal must be to defeat the Czech Republic and Austria at the same time, in order to eliminate the risk of a possible war on two fronts. \n\nBesides Hitler and Hossbach the meeting was attended by Baron Konstantin von Neurath (Foreign Minister), Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg (War Minister), General Werner von Fritsch (Army Commander), Admiral Erich Raeder (Kriegsmarine Commander) and Hermann Göring (Luftwaffe Commander)."

Hitler seized his chance and wanted to get rid of Blomberg and asked him to anull the marriage. Blomberg refused and finally had to resign - dismissed with a golden handshake of 50.000 Reichsmark. \nHitler wanted to avoid further scandals at all costs, and so the designated successor Fritsch was toppled by rumours of his alleged homosexuality (he was rehabilitated a short time later, but did not get his old position back). On 3 February 1938 Hitler demanded Fritsch's resignation and on the 5th of February he announced in a cabinet meeting that the two Generals Blomberg and Fritsch had resigned for health reasons. \n After the departure of the two officers, Hitler dissolved the Reich War Ministry and formed the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW) with Keitel as chief. He assumed the leadership of the Wehrmacht himself. He appointed General von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army (OKH), who was considered submissive and had already promised to bring the army closer to National Socialism. \nIn the last cabinet meeting of the Third Reich on February the 5th, 1938, Hitler also made public the replacement of the conservative foreign minister von Neurath by the von Ribbentrop who had been loyal to him. In this context, the important ambassadorial posts of Tokyo (Herbert von Dirksen), Vienna (Franz von Papen) and Rome (Ulrich von Hassell) were also newly filled.

Experts attribute this to the current tense international situation and the looming spectre of war that is hanging over the nation."
 news.2262.d:0	"The first fight between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling took place on 19th June 1936, at Yankee Stadium in New York, United States. Schmeling had studied Louis' style, and in the days before the fight, he claimed to have found the key to victory however many commentators thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion. \n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible. \n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime."

Wilhelm fled into exile in the Netherlands at the conclusion of the Great War, after abdicating the throne and vowing never to return to Germany until the monarchy had been restored. \n\nHe assumed the throne in 1888, upon the deaths of his grandfather Wilhelm I and his father Frederick III, who only reigned for 99 days. His oldest son, the former Crown Prince Wilhelm, who commanded the 5th Army during the Great War, is now the new head of the House of Hohenzollern."

King Farouk signed his abdication, being replaced by new king Mohammed Ali. At the same time, a new government consisting of a Wafd-led coalition was sworn in and replaced Hussein Serry Pasha’s government.\n\nThis comes at a time of greatest aggression by the Axis powers and the fear of open support for these criminals by the king.\n\nIt was above all the insubordinate proximity of the previous government to the Axis powers that made their success possible.

One of the few German proponents of strategic bombers, Wever had been discussing plans for a long-range bomber with several aircraft manufacturers as part of his 'Ural Bomber' program.

One of the few German proponents of strategic bombers, Wever has been discussing plans for a long-range bomber with several aircraft manufacturers as part of his 'Ural Bomber' program.

 blackiceairevents.11.t:0	"588th Night Bomber Regiment"
 blackiceairevents.11.d:0	"'Night Witches' was a German nickname for the women aviators of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces. Led by Major Yevdokia Bershanskaya, the regiment was made up entirely of women volunteers. It flew bombing missions against the Axis forces from its formation until the end of the war.\nIt flew over 24,000 missions and dropped 23,000 tons of bombs. It was the most highly decorated all-women unit in the Soviet Air Force, each pilot having flown over 800 missions by the end of the war and twenty-three having been awarded the 'Hero of the Soviet Union'. Thirty of its members died in combat. It flew in wood-and-canvas Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes, designed for use as training aircraft and for crop dusting. The planes could only carry six bombs at a time often flying 8 or more missions per night. \nAlthough the aircraft were obsolete and slow, the pilots made daring use of their exceptional manoeuvrability; they had the advantage of having a maximum speed that was lower than the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and as a result, German pilots found them very difficult to shoot down. An attack technique of the night bombers was to idle the engine near the target and glide to the bomb release point, with only wind noise left to reveal their location. German soldiers likened the sound to broomsticks and named the pilots 'Night Witches'. Due to the weight of the bombs and the low altitude of flight, the pilots carried no parachutes."

These are a work-around to allow the unique aircraft to work for the AI, and should not be deployed from your inventory unless you wish to manually assign aircraft to all carriers you build.

Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with \"Enigma decrypts\".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.

The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire \"shooting party\" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages.

The decision to implement conscription was driven by a number of factors, including economic concerns, a desire to preserve the country's sovereign rights, and a belief in the social value of military training.\nOne of the main reasons cited for the introduction of conscription was the economic situation facing Austria at the time. The country was struggling with high levels of unemployment and a sluggish economy, and the government saw military service as a way to provide employment and training for young people.\nAnother factor was a desire to preserve Austria's sovereign rights in the face of potential threats from other countries in Europe. The government argued that conscription was necessary to ensure the country's security and independence.\nThe failure of other signatories to the peace treaty of St. Germain to disarm was also cited as a reason for the introduction of conscription. The government believed that it was necessary for Austria to have a strong military in order to deter potential aggressors and maintain stability in the region.\nFinally, the government emphasized the social value of military training, arguing that it provided important physical, moral, and patriotic education for young people. The introduction of compulsory military service was seen as a way to promote these values and strengthen the social fabric of the country.\nThe decision to introduce conscription was controversial, and was met with opposition from some quarters. However, the government was clear in its belief that it was necessary for the country's security and prosperity, and the introduction of compulsory military service would go on to have a significant impact on Austria's history in the years that followed."

The agreement was hailed by both countries as a valuable contribution to the peaceful development of Europe.\nMany countries, however, viewed the agreement with suspicion, seeing it as a possible prelude to German expansionism.

The initial operations of an armed conflict now have a power, rapidity, and extent that are particularly alarming for countries of such extended weakness as Belgium.\nFurthermore, the reoccupation of the Rhineland by Germany, and the transfer of bases of departure to the Belgian frontier, have accentuated the country's uneasiness. Belgium has watched the shaking of the foundations of international security by the infringements of conventions freely subscribed to and the quasi-impossibility of adapting the stipulations of the Covenant of the League of Nations to the repression of these infringements.\nFinally, the internal dissensions of certain states run the risk of becoming entangled in the rivalries of the political and social systems of other states, and of unchaining a keener and more devastating conflagration than that from which we are still suffering."

The government's decision to call for their end comes after months of pressure from Italian diplomats and business interests, who have been seeking to restore normal relations with the country's trading partners.\n The move has been met with mixed reactions from the international community, with some countries expressing support for the call, while others have criticized it as premature. The League of Nations has not yet responded to the request, but it is expected to be a topic of discussion at the next meeting of the organization's governing council.\nThe Chilean government has stressed that its call for an end to the sanctions does not mean that it condones Italy's aggression in Ethiopia, but rather that it believes that the time has come to move on from the conflict and work towards a more peaceful and stable international order."

Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

Following the latter the division received 130 Czech-build tanks which were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II the division had been equipped with. In 1939, the division fought in the Invasion of Poland. Due to shortcomings that the campaign revealed in the organization of the Light divisions, it was reorganized as the 6.

However, the Great War still weighs heavily in the minds of the people. The Kronprinz did not cover himself in glory at the battle of Verdun and is fairly unpopular. Nevertheless, he would be in favor of a stronger, more centralized monarchy, granting the government more power. \n\nOn the other hand, his son Prince Louis Ferdinand, by all accounts a bright and popular young man, is a suitable choice as well.

The Ahnenerbe was part of Himmler's greater plan for the systematic creation of a	"Germanic" culture that would replace Christianity in the Greater Germany to exist after the war, a kind of SS-religion that would form the basis of the new world order. This new culture would be based on the völkisch beliefs of the Nazis, and it was the role of the Ahnenerbe to marshal scientific research in an interdisciplinary program to reject the	"priggish line of high-school professors" and support the	"development of the Germanic heritage". While the Ahnenerbe were fervent Nazis and most of their research was based on racist pseudoscience, they rejected the occult thinking of groups like the Thule Gesellschaft, preferring a pragmatic methodology based on Mendelian genetics, Darwinism, and biology."

Himmler redesigned the castle and named its rooms after military heroes in Teutonic history and folklore, such as King Arthur, King Henry the Lion, Widikund and Frederick the Great. The walls were decorated with swastikas, ancient Germanic runes, and other mystic German symbols. Special tableware, decorated with such symbols, was made for the castle.

In September 1933, Goebbels became director of the newly formed Reich Chamber of Culture, whose mission was to control all aspects of the creative arts. As the war plodded on and German casualties mounted, Goebbels became a proponent of an all-out battle to the death against the Allied forces. In this regard, he employed his own abilities as a public speaker to further incite the German populace. On one occasion, in August 1944, speaking from the Sports Palace in Berlin, he commanded the German people to support a total war effort. With Hitler's withdawal from public view, Goebbels became the public face of the Nazi Party. He visited the bombed cities and created the	"Volksstrum" militia.

Panzer Division in the winter of 1939.\nAs part of the reorganization its reconnaissance regiment of two battalions was split, one going to the 10th Panzer Division and the other staying with the 8. Panzer Division. The two battalions comprising the Panzer Regiment 10 from East Prussian were added, as was the Schützen-Brigade 8, which now controlled the 8. SchützenRegiment of three battalions and the Krad-Schützen Bataillon 8. The panzer battalions were equipped primarily with Czech tanks and Mk II light tanks, leaving the 8. Panzer Division with a total of 212 tanks (58 Mk II, 118 38t, 23 Mk IV, & 15 command tanks) in its organization for the attack into France.\nThe division also contained an anti-tank battalion of initially only two companies, equipped with the ubiquitous, but seriously under powered 37mm PAK 35/36, a pioneer battalion, signals and support units. The divisional artillery was supplied by two battalions of 105mm Howitzers.\n\nNext upgrade will in June 1941."
 germany.609.t:0	"Upgrade/Refit 9. Panzer-Division"
 germany.609.desc:0	"The 9. Panzer Division was a panzer division of the Wehrmacht Army during World War II. It came into existence after 4th Light Division was reorganized in January 1940. The division was headquartered in Vienna, in the German military district Wehrkreis XVII. Originally raised from Austrian forces annexed into Germany before the war, the 9th Panzer Division was part of most of the German Army's early Blitzkrieg attacks into western Europe. After the French campaign the division returned to Vienna in July 1940. There, it continued to reorganize and grow, adopting the organization that it kept for most of the war with 1 Pz.-regiment, 2 Pzgren.-regiments and 2 Artillery-regiment. In September 1940, it was sent to Poland with the XL Panzer Corps. In the spring of 1941, 9. Panzer Division participated in the Balkans Campaign. It was shipped to Romania and was made the armored spearhead of the 12. Armee. It managed some blitzkrieg tactics through the Balkans, separating the Greek Army from the Royal Yugoslav Army, then attacking into Yugoslavia itself. As part of the 12. Armee, the 9. Panzer Division pushed back the main British Army, Greek and Australian Army forces. Once these armies were in retreat, the division was sent to Romania in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union."
 germany.610.t:0	"Upgrade/Refit 10. Panzer-Division"
 germany.610.desc:0	"The 10th Panzer Division was first formed on 1 April 1939 in Prague, as a composite formation made-up of previously established units throughout Germany. Many of these units were transferred from the 20th Motorized Division, the 29th Motorized Division, and the 3rd Light Division. By the fall of 1939, the division was still forming, but was nonetheless committed to the 1939 Invasion of Poland before the process was complete. For that reason, the 10th Panzer Division remained in reserve for most of that campaign. It was moved from Pomerania in August into Poland, where it was hastily given control of the 7th Panzer Regiment, the 4th Panzer Brigade and several SS units.\nThe division completed its formation by the start of 1940. It consisted of the 10th Rifle Brigade with the 69. and 86. Schützen-Regiments, the 4. Panzer-Brigade with the 7. and 8. Panzer-Regiments, and the 90. Artillery-Regiment."

Even after the occupation of London, Ireland continued to delude herself as to the state of Her Majesty's Armed Forces, leaving her wholly unprepared for Britain's collapse. Within hours of Britain's capitulation both chambers of Ireland’s parliament were called in an emergency session to discuss the status of Northern Ireland. Merely two hours after the emergency session began, troop movements were reported across Ireland. Six hours after the emergency session was commenced, Irish troops began marching into Northern Ireland encountering no resistance. Britain's weak and pitiful protests were ignored as the Irish flag was raised over Belfast."

Royal assent given on 5 September 1939.\n\nThe Act established a National Register which began operating on 29 September 1939 (National Registration Day), a system of identity cards, and a requirement that they must be produced on demand or presented to a police station within 48 hours. \n\nThree main reasons for their introduction:\n\n1. The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy. \n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions. The National Register was in fact an instant census and the National Registration Act closely resembles the 1920 Census Act in many ways."

In October 1937, the airship under the command of Ivan Pankow, set a record for endurance of 130 hours and 27 minutes, beating the German Graf Zeppelin’s previous record of 111 hours and 44 minutes."

Two-hundred and twenty kilometers south of Murmansk, through a combination of fatigue, weather, darkness, and poor radio navigation equipment the airship crashed into a hillside.

The explanation was appealing to Stalin, who had already begun his policies of terror in the USSR. Vavilov was dismissed from the post of president of the VASKhNIL in 1935, with Lysenko taking the post in 1938. Lysenko has now openly accused geneticists of hampering his methods and named N.I. Vavilov and G.D. Karpechenko. A meeting of the VASKhNIL Presidium was held in April 1937, and Lysenko complained that VASKhNIL leaders supported his work poorly and that he was forced to ask for help. The VASKhNIL president, A.I. Muralov, and his deputies, A.S. Bondarenko and G.K. Meister, were shot soon afterward. Of the 52 VASKhNIL academicians, 12 were shot on false charges in 1936–1938. Prezent and Lysenko wrote an official complaint to the Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars (Prime Minister), Viacheslav Molotov. They stated that Vavilov’s public utterances were anti-Soviet, and that Vavilov, together with other geneticists, “makes every effort to give the impression of science being persecuted in our country”. Prezent and Lysenko called for the prohibition of genetics, which had allegedly become a means to fight “against avant-garde science.”"

Alksnis suggested measures such as tightening the fulfilment of orders to try and deprive spies and wreckers of the ability to hide their activity, and that those who had access to secret documents needed to be scrutinised. Alksnis also noted that those excluded from the party for political reasons should be discharged from the army.\nThe Research Centre in Voronezh will no longer be able to research Air Doctrines"

The following day Choibalsan, as Interior Minister, issued Order 366 which declared that many in Mongolia	"had fallen under the influence of Japanese spies and provocateurs." That same month Stalin, alarmed by Japanese military movements in Manchuria ordered the stationing of 30,000 Red Army troops in Mongolia and had dispatched a large Soviet delegation to Ulaanbaatar under Soviet Deputy NKVD Commissar Mikhail Frinovsky. Frinovsky, charged with setting in motion the violent purges that he had so effectively carried out in the Soviet Union under NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov, delivered a list of 115 counterrevolutionaries and Japanese collaborators to Choibalsan, recommending they be purged. Working through Soviet advisers already embedded within the Ministry of Interior and with a compliant Choibalsan providing symbolic cover, Frinovsky built the purge framework from behind the scenes; producing arrest lists and assembling an Extraordinary Purge Commission, an NKVD style troika (headed by Choibalsan, with Minister of Justice Tserendorj and former MPRP Secretary Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav) that presided over arrest cases, investigations, and show trials involving “lamas, espionage and counterrevolution.” The arrest of 65 high ranking government officials and intelligentsia on the night of Sept 10, 1937 signaled the launch of the purges in earnest. All were accused of spying for Japan as part of a Genden-Demid plot and most confessed under intense torture. The first show trial was staged at Ulaanbaatar's Central Theater from 18 to 20 October 1937. Of the 14 persons accused, 13, including former prime minister and chief abbot of the Manzushir Monastery Sambadondogiin Tserendorj, were sentenced to death."

 cairoC.6.d_fail:0	"Despite [USA.GetLeader]'s attempt to seek tighter collaboration between those who have the capability to stop [JAP.GetName]'s ambition, the idea failed completely.

 cairoC.6.d_noUS:0	"Despite being [USA.GetLeader]'s idea, the conference ends with [USA.GetLeader]'s seat empty. [CHI.GetLeader] and [ENG.GetLeader] have reached an agreement that [USA.GetLeader] could not stand. However, [ENG.GetLeader] seems to be quite disgusted towards the fact that [CHI.GetName] could gain some political benefit from the terms.\n\nSome experts say that this conference would mean that [ENG.GetName]'s relationship with [USA.GetName] would deteriorate rather quickly in the following years and might even cause blocs within the democratic world."

However, [ENG.GetLeader], who was also invited to the conference, left before signing the agreement for reasons that have not been disclosed.\n\nPeople suspect that [ENG.GetLeader] quits because the terms discussed contradicts with his personal interest as it would give [CHI.GetName] huge political benefits that would harm [ENG.GetName]'s colonial interest in the area."
 cairoC.6.d_noCN:0	"After much heated debate, [CHI.GetLeader] quited the conference with discontent as the terms were deemed \"unacceptable\" according to a spokesperson of [CHI.GetName].

The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps considering what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course, we could be more forceful instead."

 better_canada.5.d:0	"It would seem that the local garrisons of Newfoundland were extremely shocked at [ENG.GetNameDef] refusing the results of the referendum of the locals. When an angry mob approached the bases instead of fighting they instead were told to stand down by local officers, citing that it should be the will of the people to decide their own fate. As a result, the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0	"Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0	"Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops could leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."

 BICE_britain.4.d:0	"Today is the day when King Haile Selassie could finally return to his beloved Addis Ababa. At his side, battle-hardened units of the Gideon Force as well as patriotic liberation forces - the Arbanyoch - who nervously looked to the right and left, ready to defend the Emperor.\nBut how unnecessary this was! The Emperor was received euphorically and the inhabitants celebrated the liberation of the Italian yoke. In his black vehicle, accompanied by his honour escort and the British Colonel Orde Wingate, the Emperor made his way to the heart of the city, where he said a prayer of thanksgiving in the Church of the Virgin Mary.\nHe then took a bath in the crowd, children danced, drums were beaten, people threw themselves on the ground and celebrated this great triumph against the Axis aggressors.\n Finally arriving at the palace, it was time to address his people."
#\n\nOur people of Ethiopia! Listen!\nThanks be to Almighty God who is impartial to all, Who can break the arms of the strong and who stands by the oppressed.\nWhen Our long-time enemy, Italy, crossed Our border and occupied Our country by aggressive force, We fought to defend Our country as much as We could and then went to Europe to solicit help while you, patriots of Ethiopia, continued the struggle and waited for Us fighting day and night in the forests and mountains against the militarily superior brutal enemy, in taking advantage of your natural heroism as your greatest weapon, never putting aside your swords, abandoning your flag or surrendering to alien rule.\nAs you now see, your year-long struggle has made it possible for you to witness the fruits of your efforts and sacrifices.\nWe have told you before that We have brought for you with us, the aid of Great Britain which
#promised Us to completely dispel Our enemy from Our country and restore Our independence. Our happiness is boundless when We announce to you that We have returned to Our beloved country, with God's will, and to be present amidst Our people who We have been missing for some time.\nOur people of Ethiopia!\nYou know how grim life is to people robbed of their government, independence and their motherland.\nThe time has now come when each and everyone of us should protect and serve Our beloved country, Ethiopia, with more zeal and vigour.\nThe Almighty God has been merciful to all of Us. Therefore, We have given mercy to those of you who, willingly or unwillingly, betrayed your country and your Emperor while here or abroad, and We urge you, wherever you may be, to raise your arms against the enemy who has come, determined to destroy your race, confiscate your property and spoil your name. Now you must throw him out of Ethiopia.\nItaly is now in great despair, pressured by Great Britain's air,
#sea and land forces and those Italian soldiers remaining in Our country will not be beyond the challenge of Our reliable patriotic forces.\nWe express Our gratitude to the government and people of Great Britain, for all the world to hear, on behalf of you and Ourselves, for the warm, generous and cordial reception and welcome they accorded Us during Our most trying period

The Act also prohibited organising, training or equipping an association of persons for enabling them to be employed in usurping the functions of the police or of the armed forces of the Crown, or for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political object. \n\nThe Act had the indirect result of improving the stance of the BUF.  Their forced abandonment of paramilitary and armed tactics improved the party's relations with the police, and in making it more respectable increased the BUF appeal among traditionally conservative middle-class citizens who became the party's main base in the years after the Public Order Act 1936 was passed."

This would eventually rise to forty-three battalions. To achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR. This expansion required ten training centres to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions were raised, while other units were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas. Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialised functions such as Para troops, signals, engineers, and military police. A total of 250000 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, plus Parachute, training, garrison, and porter units during the war, in almost all theatres. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in Syria, North Africa, Italy, Greece and against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, northeast India and also Singapore.  They did so with considerable distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theatres."

Around 200 men (or \"Crusaders\" as they prefer to be referred to as) marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re-establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, Palmer's shipyard. The petition was received by the House of Commons but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The marchers went home believing that they had failed. Despite the initial sense of failure among the marchers, in subsequent years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining event of the 1930s. It helped to foster the change in attitudes which prepared the way to social reform measures after the Second World War, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the \"spirit of Jarrow\" in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party's coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march as a metaphor for governmental callousness and working-class fortitude."

It condemned	"pantheistic confusion",	"neopaganism",	"the so-called myth of race and blood", and the idolizing of the State. It contained a vigorous defense of the Old Testament with the belief that it prepares the way for the New. It states that race is a fundamental value of the human community, which is necessary and honorable but condemns the exaltation of race, or the people, or the state, above their standard value to an idolatrous level. Also declaring	"that man as a person possesses rights he holds from God, and which any collectivity must protect against denial, suppression or neglect." Although National Socialism, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party are not named in the document all those who hear it know exactly who is being criticized with some even believing it labels the Fuhrer a 'mad prophet'.

 political.30.desc:0	"The idea of a monarchy in [Root.GetName] has never really died, no matter how long ago it may have been. Royalists have always, and likely will always, be around, but this year things seem to be different. There's a new energy within the Royalist movement, one that could turn take this ideology out of the shadows and into mainstream politics. \n\nThe question remains: are the [Root.GetAdjective] people ready for monarchism?"
 political.30.a:0	"There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.30.a.tt:0	"Increases the chance of internal support for a monarchist coup."

 political.31.t:0	"Monarchist Sympathies in Government"
 political.31.desc:0	"While certainly the [Root.GetLeader] government is no friend to the monarchists, the same cannot be said for all of their ministers. Rumours continue to spread of the many Royalist sympathizers within the ranks of the [Root.GetRulingParty], despite the best efforts of party elders to stamp them out. \n\nThese secret supporters have been quietly lobbying for making compromises with the Royalists in the hopes of avoiding future calamity, or at least keep any sort of change as bloodless as possible."
 political.31.a:0	"This could lead to something extraordinary."
 political.31.a.tt:0	"If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.32.t:0	"Monarchists Execute Coup"
 political.32.desc:0	"Today is a day that will live long in the memories of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. In a stunning turn of events, the Royalists have managed to outmanoeuvre the [Root.GetLeader] government and place them under arrest! \n\nWell placed ministers and officers within the [Root.GetRulingParty] government and [Root.GetAdjective] military seized on the chaos to arrest or silence loyalists throughout the capitol and major cities. Royalists around the country, realizing what was happening, took to the streets in support of this bold action, lending valuable credibility and authority to their actions at a critical juncture. Seemingly without the support of the public or the military, the [Root.GetLeader] government has been completely ousted from power. \n\nWhile the coup is still on going, it is safe to say that {Root.GetName] is in store for some wild times ahead."

Slogans like these ring through the streets of every major city in [Root.GetName]. The Royalists have been rapidly expanding their power base and can claim supporters in the millions. They rail against the [Root.GetLeader] government's failures and scandals, claiming that a monarchy would never debase itself in such a manner. \n\nEven worse, they are actively calling for people across the nation to resist the authority of the current government, advocating for a passive resistance in the name of bringing down the [Root.GetRulingParty]. It is hard to say what the ultimate consequences of this will be, but the country has not been this divided in quite some time."

The Goering 4 year Plan was actually the second 4 Year Plan to be implimented. It was announced in September, 1936. The Four-Year Plan had four priorities: 1. To increase agricultural production. 2. Retrain key sectors of the work force. 3. Government regulation of imports and exports. 4. To achieve self-sufficiency in the production of raw materials. Coupled with the later formation of the Reichswerke Herman Goering, and the full backing of Hitler, Goering's control  of the German economy was complete.

Alongside general fatigue of Conservative policies, plus the usual democratic swing against a long-term ruling party, Labour has been making steady gains. Particularly following the Beveridge Report's release in 1942, which expected post-war governments to become much more involved in the economy to improve social welfare, the Labour platform has become quite popular among the voters, making a Conservative victory in the upcoming election increasingly unlikely."

Beveridge proposes a series of widespread reforms to the system of social welfare, many of which are proving highly popular among the voters. Many Conservative leaders, who may agree somewhat in principle that some smaller measures must be taken, are certainly not committed to such a massive financial endeavour.

Advancing through Toulon, the Germans occupied heights overlooking the channel and air-dropped mines to prevent a French escape.\nReaching the gates of the naval base, the Germans were delayed by the sentries who demanded paperwork allowing admission. By 5:25 AM, German tanks entered the base and de Laborde issued the scuttle order from his flagship Strasbourg. Fighting soon broke out along the waterfront, with the Germans coming under fire from the ships. Out-gunned, the Germans attempted to negotiate, but were unable to board most vessels in time to prevent their sinking. German troops successfully boarded the cruiser Dupleix and closed its sea valves, but were driven off by explosions and fires in its turrets. Soon the Germans were surrounded by sinking and burning ships.

Following the capitulation of France, the occupying Germans were reluctant to work with the collaboration government of Vichy France. The failure of the Battle of Britain and struggles in the Italian-controlled Africa, Hitler and his government leaned towards a more friendly relationship. The old warhorse, Marshal Petain, headed the collaborationist government, though the Nazis preferred working through Deputy Prime Minister Pierre Laval. As a gesture of good will towards the French people, an elaborate ceremony was planned returning Napoleon II’s corpse to France. However, a crisis erupted between Petain, who ordered the arrest of Pierre Laval, who was subsequently protected by the German ambassador and a heavily armed SS unit who rushed protect Laval.\nOn December 12th, 1940, in Vienna, the crypt of Capuchins was opened and Napoleon II’s sarcophagus was removed and placed on a train. The train, with a special honor guard, going in the opposite direction, followed a course the conquering father took. On December 14th, reached the Garde de l’Est. At 11pm on December 15th, 1940, as a light freezing rain mixed with snow and flurries fell, the Eaglet’s bronze sarcophagus was lifted by twenty-four men and placed on a carriage which was attached to an armored track vehicle, flanked by a light artillery battery. The political gesture marched down the empty streets of Paris, no member of the Bonaparte family or Vichy representative present, and minus the prince’s heart and insides, which remained behind in Vienna.\nThe weather resembled the father’s retreat from Russia rather than sunny coronation of the Emperor. The imprisoned Prince travelled in front of the Chatelet Column, which celebrated his father’s victories, and the shadows of the Tuileries palace, where he was born. The carriage entered the Invalides and circled the building before stopping at the door of the Dome church. The spectacle was watched over by Admiral Darlan, Generals Laure and La Laurenice, and minister Abel Bonnard. Darlan stepped forward and thanked the German ambassador for returning the son of our Emperor to us."

The IJN Sōryū (\"Blue Dragon\") and IJN Hiryū (\"Flying Dragon\") were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations. These were the first modern aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the platform further aircraft carrier development was based on."

Completed shortly before the start of the Pacific War in 1941, they have been called \"arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world\" when built. The Shōkaku-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised for a totla of 84 aircraft."

After the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the ship's unfinished hull (45% construction completed) converted into an aircraft carrier. The Shinano featured the heaviest anti-aircraft armament of all IJN carriers, heavy armor protection and was the very first carrier of the IJN to have a full amored flight deck, thanks to its Yamato-class legacy. The Shinano-class carried a huge air group of 120 aircrafts. The Imperial Japanese Navy decided that carriers of the heavily armored Shinano class would either serve as a support carrier or floating battle fortress at the frontline for the Combined Fleets battle line."

Her design was that of a modified Shōkaku with slightly reduced speed but stronger hull and armor protection. Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers featuring a amored flight deck and better overall armor protection against dive bombers and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Also, the anti-aircraft armament was significantly increased. After the launch of the IJN Taiho, it became almost immediately the flagship of the Combined Fleet."

Their air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M \"Claude\" fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 Aichi D3A \"Val\" dive bombers, with an additional 2 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bombers.

In the lead-up to the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to build many fleet carriers, in fact 16. The lead ship was IJN Unryū (\"Cloud Dragon\") For them to be built quickly, the design for these ships was based on the aircraft carrier Hiryū rather than the newer and more sophisticated Taihō or the Shōkaku class. The Unryū-class aircraft carrier design was very similar to that of Hiryū. The ships were lightly built, and the main difference from Hiryū was that the carriers' island was placed on the starboard side of the ships.

The Casablanca-class escort carriers are the most numerous class of aircraft carriers ever built. Fifty were laid down, launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years – 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944. These were nearly one third of the 151 carriers built in the United States during the war. It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions. It also had a larger flight deck than the Bogue class. Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor, protection was limited to splinter plating and therefore the carrier design was very vulnerable."

Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, there was fear that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers who wanted to take advantage of the country's strategic position. The military, therefore, wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted beginning in 1937 and the following year. The result was a triangular runway built at Banak.\nDuring the World War II German occupation of Norway, Banak was taken over by the Luftwaffe. They were planning an attack on the Soviet Union from Finnmark and decided to designate Banak as their main air base in Northern Norway. By September 1940, the main runway was extended to 1,000 by 200 meters (3,280 by 660 ft) with a wooden surface. In addition, three hangars were built, allowing the air base to house bombers. The main function of the air station was to attack the Arctic convoys. By 1943 there were two parallel runways, both 1,800 meters (5,900 ft) long. The air station was blasted in October 1944 during Operation Nordlicht, the German retreat from Finnmark"

He repeatedly appealed to the crowd, which cheered and groaned at appropriate moments.\n Referring to the League's imposition of sanctions against Italy during the Abyssinian war, Mussolini declared that Italy would never forget this 'shameful attempt at the strangulation of the Italian people' for which reparation had never been made. 'It is grotesque,' he said, 'to believe that pressure was exerted on us to decide. Our comrades of the Berlin-Tokyo axis have shown absolute discretion.\n There is no undue concern in Britain about the Italian decision, which was expected. In fact, the Dictator's speech, which followed a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, made less impression than had been anticipated, as it had been believed that he might have announced other decisions calculated more to complicate the international situation.\n Apparently Germany had previously been informed of the decision, for the newspapers in Berlin wholeheartedly agreed with it."

Finland has never taken any measures against her powerful neighbor. She invariably has expended the greatest efforts in order to live at peace with the USSR. Nevertheless, basing itself on the alleged refusal of Finland to agree on the question of the so-called border incidents, and accusing Finland of allegedly refusing to agree to the strengthening of the security of Leningrad, the USSR first denounced the above-mentioned non-aggression pact, and then rejected the proposal of the Government of Finland to resort to mediation by some neutral power. On instructions from my Government I have the honor of informing you of the above-mentioned facts, with the request to have the kindness to convene the Council and the Assembly immediately, as provided by Articles 11 and 15 of the Covenant, and to request them to take all necessary measures to stop aggression, I shall not fail to furnish you with a complete statement of the reasons and circumstances which compelled my Government to request the League of Nations to intervene in the conflict which has led to a clash between two of its members.

The committee appointed a subcommittee comprising delegates from Bolivia, France, Portugal, Britain and Sweden to complete the draft report for the meeting of the Assembly on the next day. \n The committee found Russia guilty of violating one of its responsibilities under the Covenant, but also that it had placed itself outside of it.\n On the [?assemble_variable.GetDateStringNoHour], the League Council decided to expel Russia by seven votes to four, with four abstentions and three absentees.

He said: 'If we fail the world will doubt the reality of our conviction, and the structure we are striving to maintain would dangerously be shaken.' M.

As is often the case in Western history, the glory of the Roman Empire inspired following civilizations, and the term palatium, or palace, never lost its ideological charge. Instead, it became part of the vocabulary of every modern language, employed to indicate the physical location of power.\nIn its early days in Geneva, the League of Nations Secretariat were quartered at the Hôtel National. It was clear from the beginning that the hotel was ill-suited as an administrative building. When the Swiss authorities offered a site for a new conference hall, therefore, the League seized the opportunity: in 1924, the Assembly asked for a building which was to \"perform fully and adequately the essential function and purposes of an Assembly Hall of the League of Nations\"\nThe general thought was that if the intentions of the League of Nations is to represent the pacific glory of the XX century are sincere, then it is not possible to constrain such an innovative social organization to the straitjacket of traditional architecture. No colonnaded hall for bored sovereigns, but salubrious working rooms for the busy representatives of the various peoples. No dark corridors for the intrigues of diplomacy, but open, glazed spaces for public negotiations carried by honest men.\nAfter starting building in 1931, now finally the League of Nations can move into their new home. And the League does so in troubled times. Not only have some members left the exclusive gathering, but with rising aggression, the League faces challenges nobody ever predicted so early in its short history.\nThe future will show whether this palace stands the test of time!"

Austria's alteration of this part of the treaty by a unilateral denunciation was seen as a manifest infringement of the military clauses of the treaty.\nThe Little Entente deeply regretted Austria's decision to take this course, which represented a negation of international obligations. They pointed out that Austria was a member of the League of Nations and had, in fact, been condemned by the Council of the League of Nations for taking a similar course of action in the past.\nThe Little Entente could not admit that Austria should be allowed to take the law into its own hands by this unilateral step, which was a clear violation of international obligations. They called on Austria to reverse its decision and abide by the Treaty of Saint-Germain.\nAustria rejected the protest, arguing that they had drafted the new bill deliberately and with the knowledge that they had fulfilled their obligations to provide the necessities of life to the Austrian people and to safeguard the existence of the Austrian state. They argued that the introduction of compulsory conscription was necessary for the economy, the preservation of sovereign rights, and the maintenance of the existing European order."

 league.27.d:0	"The International Conference on the Repression of Terrorism was held from November 1-16, 1937, in Geneva, Switzerland. The conference was attended by representatives of various countries and organizations, including the League of Nations, and was convened in response to the growing threat of terrorist activities across the world.\n The conference was divided into three main sessions, during which various issues related to terrorism were discussed and debated. These included the definition of terrorism, the causes of terrorism, and the measures that could be taken to combat it. The conference also discussed the legal and political aspects of terrorism, including the role of international law in combating terrorism, the jurisdiction of national courts in prosecuting terrorists, and the rights of victims of terrorism.\n The conference resulted in the adoption of a Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which set out a comprehensive legal framework for combating terrorism. The convention defined terrorism as 'criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or the general public.' It also established a range of measures for preventing and punishing terrorism, including the extradition of terrorists, the seizure of terrorist assets, and the imposition of severe penalties for terrorist activities.\n However many states within and without the LON refused to rafity the agreements due to the extradition clauses giving it limited value"

However, the Ecuadorean government argued that it was acting in the best interests of the country by seeking to maintain positive relations with Italy.\nThe lifting of the sanctions was seen as a significant victory for Italy, which had faced increasing isolation and condemnation from the international community in the wake of its invasion of Ethiopia.
