By this time France's own demands for rearmament prohibited further development.\n\nIn August and September 1939, as a stopgap measure, forty-one R 35s were supplied to the Royal Romanian Army. These tanks served as the principal tank of the newly-formed 2nd Armoured Regiment. At the end of September 1939, an additional thirty-four brand new R 35s passed into Romanian hands when the Polish 21st Light Tank Battalion (Batalion Czolg�w Lekkich,or BCL) chose internment over capture following the German conquest of Poland.

Therefore, the tanks were sent back and changed in accordance with Romanian requirements.\n\nAll 126 tanks (called R-2 in Romania) were received by 1939, but another order for 382 tanks sent in mid-1939 was refused by the Germans. The R2 tanks were used as the backbone of Romanian armored warfare in the beginning of Operation Barbarossa."
