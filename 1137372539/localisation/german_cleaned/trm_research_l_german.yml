They can be made of any material, but are frequently made of ceramic or laminated materials. Like reactive armor, applique armor is an easy and cost-effective way of improving the protection of older vehicles.\n\nIt is important to note that, assuming the same armor quality, the resistance to penetration of one armor plate of a given thickness will be greater than the resistance of two armor plates of the same combined thickness."

The rounds in each rack were surrounded by separate small containers of a mixture of water, ethylene glycol, and a rust inhibitor, known as	"Ammudamp". The rounds aren't actually	"wet", they are separated by the small liquid containers. When the ammunition rack was hit, the logic was that the liquid would spill out, quenching any fires, similar to flooding the magazine on a warship.\n\n144 liters of Ammudamp were needed for 100 shells."

 tech_trm_suspension_horstmann_modified_eng_desc:0	"The Horstmann suspension was a type of bogie suspension. Two wheels are mounted to a common framework in a L-shape swing arm that froms a bell crank with a coil spring running in between both end points. The setup is arranged in such a way that if one wheel moves up, the spring is compressed against the swing arm of the other wheel.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the Horstmann system was that it couldn't handle heavy weights very well. This was mainly overcome by introducing two more springs in the frame."

It would need another 6 months to enter mass production i.e. 5 months after Operation Barbarossa.\n\nWhen the Russian “T-34” and “KV” tanks appeared at the start of the Russian campaign, the weakness of the German tank armament was quickly revealed to its fullest extent. KwK 38 L/42 could only destroy russian tanks at suicidal distances. Furthermore, Hitler's discovery in April 1941 that his orders had been deliberately sidestepped by the German Army generated in him a distrust which lasted through to the end of the conflict and had catastrophical consequences.As a German general put it,	"it costed Germany the war".\n\nHad the KwK 39 L/60 armed Panzer III been available in numbers in June 1941, the Eastern Campaign could have gone very different.

Meanwhile, Henschel, at request of Hitler, had chosen a 7.5cm gun and the design fell on Rheinmetall.\n\nBy early 1942, Porsche's design had a lot of problems and the situation was as follows: Krupp had a working turret with a 8.8 cm gun in a problematic chassis while Henschel had a working hull waiting for the development of the 7.5cm gun.

At the same time, longer gun barrel would decrease the agility of the tank, becoming a hindrance.\n\nFor all these reasons, a new special category of SPG was created, called Sturmhaubitze or StuH, specialized in infantry support, leaving the StuG as more of a powerful anti-tank weapon.

The Wehrmacht already had enough heavy guns for such purpose, the problem was that most of these were tied to railroads and unable to maneuver inside cities. Those mounted in tracked chassis were unprotected and thus unable to take a direct role in tactical urban warfare.\n\nInitially a 21cm Howitzer was meant to be designed specifically to be mounted as self-propelled in tank chassis, but the deteriorating strategic situation caused the development of the 21cm to grind to a halt. As Hitler was fuming over this obstacles, on April 11 1943 Albert Speer brought him news of the possible salvaging of the concept by arming a Tiger I chassis with a modified version of the Navy's 38cm rocket depth charge launcher.\n\nThe 38cm L/5,4 RTgW was a breech-loaded rocket depth charge launcher, designed by Rheinmetall-Borsig for the Kriegsmarine to defend harbors and naval bases against submarines. It's short range, not exceeding 3000 meters, meant that the field of fire was rather small so the Navy had already planned in 1941-42 to design a tracked chassis to mount the gun. However, the Navy had no technical ability to design, develop and build such weapon.\n\nYears later, the idea survived and was then presented in 1943 to the Fuhrer.\n\nThe modification was pretty thorough: the launcher itself was re-designed and new ammunition was developed capable of penetrating buildings. The already existing projectile was a depth-charge which was designed for underwater physics. Pulverizing stubborn cities into submission called for a shell stout enough to penetrate into structures and explode inside, where it could wreck much havoc. In the end two shells were developed, High Explosive and HEAT, to be able to penetrate heavily fortified buildings. The revised aerodynamics of the projectile coupled with the redesigned launcher almost doubled the range to 5700 meters. The new gun was to be called the 38 cm Raketenwerfer 61 (38cm RW 61)."

Tungsten Carbide has nearly twice the density of steel so a round designed for a six-pounder gun may weight more than ten pounds. This would mean a lower muzzle velocity, longer flight time and more curved trajectory, greatly reducing the chances of the round killing a tank.\n\nOne solution to this problem was the APCR round or Armour Piercing Composite Rigid. A small core of Tungsten is surrounded by a sleeve or sabot of lighter material such as steel, alloy or aluminum. This sabot is fixed to the core and does not separate from it once the round leaves the muzzle. On impact with the target the surrounding sleeve breaks up while the hard dense core punches through the armour.

 tech_trm_ammo_ger_heat_early_desc:0	"\n\n\n\n£Early_Heat\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) is a type of explosive that uses the Munroe effect to penetrate heavy armor.\nThe warhead functions by having an explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity superplastic jet; this is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge.\nThe jet's effect is purely kinetic in nature; the round has no explosive or incendiary effect on the target. The jet moves at hypersonic speeds in solid material and therefore erodes exclusively in the local area where it interacts with armor material.\n\nGermany was one of the first to introduce this concept by mid 1940 and was an avid user of it due to it's 'cheap' nature. APCR costed Tungsten, which Germany lacked."
