 nrm_mahanian_concepts:0	"Mahanian Doctrine Concepts"
 nrm_mahanian_concepts_desc:0	"Our navy should follow the concepts laid down by Admiral Mahan (USN). Large capital ships, built to battle with the enemies main battle fleet are the way to beat the enemy. Concentration of force and numbers of capital ships in one place are the way to go."
 nrm_jeune_ecole_concepts:0	"Jeune Ecole Concepts"
 nrm_jeune_ecole_concepts_desc:0	"If we are to beat other nations that have larger navies than ours, we will need to fight them on unequal terms. Use of smaller ships in an aggressive manner means we can close with and engage the enemy in fights on our terms, making the size difference of their capital ships less of a factor."
 nrm_commerce_warfare:0	"Commerce Warfare"

 ## WW1 Capital Doctrine
 nrm_battlefleet_concentration:0	"Battlefleet Concentration"

 nrm_submarine_offensive_operations_desc:0	"Allowing our submarines to operate independently of the rest of the fleet will allow them to use their stealthy characteristics to the best of their ability. Submarines that are operating independently will also be more likely to escape after ambushing a convoy."
 nrm_submarine_fleet_operations:0	"Submarine Fleet Operations Priority"
 nrm_submarine_fleet_operations_desc:0	"Integrating our submarines into our surface fleets can allow them to be used as a hugely capable scouting and reconnaissance asset, providing intelligence on enemy ship locations and shadowing potential targets until the surface fleet can arrive."

 nrm_submarine_raiding_improved_desc:0	"By further emphasising the independence of the submarines from the surface fleet, we can allow our submarine captains a substantial degree of autonomy to engage enemy shipping.

 nrm_submarine_long_range:0	"Long Range Submarine Operations"

 nrm_submarine_wolfpack_desc:0	"When one of our submarines detects a convoy, it will not engage it immediately. It will contact other submarines in the area and shadow the convoy. At dusk, once all the contacted submarines have arrived, the attack will commence. This will focus our submarines firepower and ambush characteristics into a lethal result."
 nrm_submarine_tactics_advanced:0	"Advanced Submarine Tactics"
