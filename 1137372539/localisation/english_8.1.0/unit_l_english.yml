 #GER_anti_tank_heavy_desc:0 "Heavy Anti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. To keep up with the mobile forces the AT-guns were motorized and got trucks to pull the guns. In order to penetrate vehicle armor they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle. Any field artillery cannon with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its caliber was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet A-19.\nPrior to World War II few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50 mm. Examples of guns in this class include the German 37 mm, US 37 mm (the largest gun able to be towed by the jeep), French 25 mm and 47 mm guns, British QF 2-pounder (40 mm), Italian 47 mm and Soviet 45 mm. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks."

They were armed with eight 203mm guns, and could make nearly 34 knots, but they had just 30mm of armour protection, limited to covering key areas."
