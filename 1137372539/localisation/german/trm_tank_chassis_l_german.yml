Although not the most effective in tank versus tank combat, it played an important role in training a new generation of German tank crew members and in spurring further tank development. Furthermore, it was highly important during the early phases of the Second World War. The Panzer I Ausf.A first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and in the Second Sino-Japanese War, being Germany’s first true export tank. Its frontline service life ended in 1941, by which point the Panzer I was considered unsuitable even in the reconnaissance role, though it continued to see service as a training and auxiliary tank.\n\nThe main changes over it's predecessor mainly included the enlargement of the return rollers, bigger fuel tanks, and the increase of the hull height by 50 mm. Additionally, for the first time, Wa. Prüf. 6 wanted a radio set inside the tank to improve communication. Therefore, a more powerful electric generator had to be fitted inside the rear. Later, the proposed increase in the hull height was canceled. Before entering production, a new cooling system was implemented. It consisted of two air filters and air intakes which greatly improved the cooling of the engine"

 trm_light_tank_chassis_ger_panzer1_2_desc:0	"Type - Light Tank\n\nThe main reason why an upgrade was needed was the Ausf.A’s weak engine, which often could not effectively power the tank. Suffering from breakdowns, not being able to climb up steep hills or reaching a specific speed, the Krupp air-cooled 4-cylinder model 1931 engine was only adequate for a short time.\n\nAs for the changes, the original shape of the Ausf.A was maintaned with the same arrangement of the major components. The most significant changes were made to the engine compartment, which was made to be able to fit a water cooled engine.\n\nThe Ausf.Bs shared a similar fate and combat history as the Ausf.A, seeing service in Spain, Poland, France, and lastly, the USSR, where their participation in combat ended. After that, along with its previous version, the Ausf.B was used for garrison roles and training purposes."

The previous versions Ausf.a/1, a/2, a/3, b and c were all trial series developed to test new design elements.\n\nThe tank’s electrical system was supressed to try and stop it interfering with the AM radio reception and transmission. A new front belly was reinforced for the new transmission mounts, the drain valves in the belly enlarged and relocated, a drain for the radiator, an access opening in the firewall, standardized 8mm fuel lines, the fuel pump, oil filter and oil cooler relocated on the engine space, simplified lubrication of the steering unit and shorter final drive shafts.\n\nThe previous large flat rectangular driver’s visor was replaced by a V-formed smaller driver’s visor with a vision slit and all three vision ports in the superstructure -two for the driver and one for the radio operator- had vision slits.\nTo eliminate cracks in the armor from automotive stresses a reinforcing rod was added to the rear.\n\nThe tank saw service starting in the Polish campaign, but by 1941 was already withdrawn to reconnaissance and training duties.\n\n\nMax Armor: 25mm\nMax Engine: 180 HP"

This experience required an increase in the number of crew members, a larger engine power reserve, a radio station with a large range, etc.\n\nThe Ausf.

According to a report from July of 1941, the Pz.Kpfw.I C. would only be used by airborne troops and expeditionary forces.

II. MAN was given the contract. However, the suspension was not the only thing that would change.\n\nIt was requested that the chassis be reworked, since the internal layout was inefficient. The engine, as well as the gearbox, were shifted to the right. The driver and radio operator's stations were roomy as a result, but the tank's front right corner was empty. A new idea was to place the radio operator to the right of the driver, with the engine in the center of the engine compartment. In order to free up space for two crewmen in the front, the new gearbox was coupled with the engine, connected to the main clutch by a long shaft. The driver and radio operator were very comfortable in their seats.\n\n\nMax Armor: 40mm\nMax Engine: 200"

One was to engage enemy tanks and the second was to act as a fire support vehicle. The role of the anti-tank vehicle was to be carried out by the Panzer III series.\n\nThe first of the Panzer III series was the Ausf.A version. This vehicle served mostly as a testbed for the new concept of a medium tank designed to engage enemy armor. While this vehicle would be built in limited numbers, it would see some combat action during the early days of the war due to the German Army’s lack of tanks. Despite its flaws and small production run, the Panzer III Ausf.A was the first step towards the development of what would become Germany’s main combat tank until it was superseded by the long-barrelled Panzer IV from 1942 on.\n\n\nMax Armor: 30mm\nMax Engine: 325"

Even Hitler had something to say about it. The first reaction to the new contingency was a contract awarded to Rheinmetall to develop a new gun able to pierce armor of 150mm at 1000 metres.\n\nBy the end of November 1941, Daimler and MAN were asked to submit projects for a new tank of the weight of 35 tons to mount the new gun. MAN eventually won the contest and the Panther entered mass production in 1943. It's most distinguished feature was the use of sloped armor (first time for the Germans).\n\nConsidered by many ordnance experts to be the finest medium tank used in WW2, the rule of thumb in the U.S. Army was that it took five Shermans to knock out a single Panther.\n\nThe Panther emerged as one of the most significant tank designs in history. Large numbers were captured and tested, and Panthers were used by the French army until the 1950's, perhaps the most eloquent testimony to the capabilities of this fine combat vehicle.\n\n\nMax Armor: 110\n Max Engine: 750 HP"

It had to be a symbol of the renewal of the German Army and was conceived in quite a hurry.\n\nThe Neubaufahrzeug was intended to fulfill the role of a medium tank in Germany's developing armored force, but it proved to have too many problems with its front drive and aero-engine for this role. But even with all its faults, the Neubaufahrzeug provided insight into tank designing that was valuable for the next German medium tank project, the Begleitwagen ("accompanying vehicle"), which would enter service as the Panzer IV."

 trm_heavy_tank_chassis_ger_tiger_1_desc:0	"Type - Heavy Tank\n\nThere is possibly no other weapon more well known, and more revered than the Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger. The Tiger had its origins in a number of tank developments initiated in 1937.\n\nBy 1937, the Heereswaffenamt had already given orders to develop a new tank in the 30-ton class with the companies Daimler-Benz, Henschel and MAN. At that time Nazi intelligence had become disturbed by the Char B1 (bis) and Char 2C heavy tanks in service with the French Army. These were the only contemporary heavy enemy tanks known to the German military as being ready for action.\n\nBy 1939, Henschel delivered a functional prototype, with proven tank design principles with a rear-mounted engine and the transmission in the front of the hull. At approximately the same time, Professor Dr. Ferdinand Porsche received a development order for a heavy tank (MAN and Daimler-Benz were put out of contention by Henschel's technical superiority).\n\nAfter the outbreak of the war, armor and armament requirements of the Heavy Tank kept changing, delaying a final version for the design. Furthermore, the Army wasn't really feeling the utmost necessity for it because of the initial effortless victories.\n\nIn 1941 after the appearence of KV-1 and T-34 this changed dramatically. After a famous Panzerkomission was sent in November of 1941 to the Eastern Front to assess the technical situation of tanks, the final requirements were issued and both Porsche and Henschel were to present their prototypes on April 20 1942, Hitler's birthday.\n\nContrary to common belief, while the Henschel prototype was considered superior, Hitler accepted Porsche's design (probably because of his friendship with Porsche) and wanted both versions produced. In fact, the new schwere Panzer divsions, selected for deployment to North Africa, were to be equipped with the Porsche type, probably because his version had air cooled power units.\n\nIn the end, Porsche's units had so many mechanical failures that production had to be totally canceled. By mid 1942 Henschel's version was the only one to enter mass production, known as the Tiger.\n\nThe efectiveness of this weapon is still a topic of discussion in many circles up to this day. One thing is for certain: it was a remarkable machine for it's time which inspired truly mixed emotions. Fear and terror for it 's enemies, invicibility for it's users and friends and admiration for the technophiles.\n\n\nMax Armor: 130mm\nMax Engine: 800 HP"

It had resulted from the need to create a tank capable of dealing with any new tank development that the Russians could possibly produce as well as fixing several of the reliability issues in the Tiger I.\n\nHitler had instructed to simply “improve” all components of the Tiger I. In August 1942, the Heereswaffenamt issued specifications for a redesigned Tiger incoporating thicker armour, and, more importantly, a turret capable of fitting a 8.8cm L/71 gun which the Tiger I couldn't manage.\n\nBoth Porsche and Henschel again were asked to submit designs to these specifications. Porsche's designs were this time quickly rejected and his tank project cancelled, specially because his electrical transmission required copper, which was in shortage.\n\nHenschel's second design was extremely liked since it incorporated several components and design features of the experimental Panther II, such as sloped armor and the suspension, which consisted of nine sets of interlaced road wheels sprung on torsion bars.\n\nThe Tiger II, like it's predecessor, is a figure of controversy and historical debate. On one hand it was a Tank that had realistically no match, and was capable of easily destroying any tank it faced. On the other hand, it is said that the effort both in development and resources was a waste.\n\nThe facts are: It was the largest and heaviest operational tank fielded by the German Army in WW2, meant to be THE heavy tank capable of breaking through enemy lines and smashing their defenes and tanks in the process. It's nickname, boasting	"King or Royal" is a testament to it's magnificent size and what it represented: seemingly inpenetrable armor and devastating firepower.\n\n\nMax Armor: 160mm\nMax Engine: 900 HP"

The vehicle was planned to be used as a tank for breaking through well-fortified defensive lines, then at the end of the war it was considered as another	"miracle weapon" capable of stopping the offensive of the tank formations of the Red Army.\n\nConceptual designs of super heavy tanks had been on going for several years now, but progress was extremely slow, specially since after the first years of the war, mobility was considered the most important feature of tanks.\n\nIn 1940 Soviet intelligence received information that the Germans used heavy tanks in France and that they were developing a tank above 90 tons. Neither were true, bue nevertheless these reports provoked development of KV-3, KV-4 and KV-5.\n\nThese developments, known by the Germans in 1941, added to the fact that Soviet tank design was considered superior, made Hitler act fast and obtain great interest in developing a tank prepared to deal with the upcoming menaces. Krupp was directed to develop a 100-ton tank by 1943.\n\nIn 1942 Porsche again joined the development contest, and for the first time, he won. Krupp was relegated to just building the turret. By the time the first prototype came out, the tank would weight 180 tons (almost double the original), caused above all by Hitler's repeated wishes for even heavier armor, which finally reached a thickness of 240mm.\n\nHitler insisted on armor and firepower and regarded speed as not that important. The resources invested in this vehicle left absolutely no room for failure. Giving everything the Reich had just to get beaten by the Soviets would de facto imply the technological superiority of communism.\n\nHowever, to move this monster, which was more like a traveling bunker than a tank, many difficult technical problems had to be solved. When it comes to the Maus, Porsche peaked. Not only the giant was quite nimble for its size, capable of 20kph, but also the tests that were able to be showed incredible promising results all around. At it's lastest hour, it seemed Porsche had finally delivered his masterpiece, although it was too late. In mid 1943 a bombing raid destroyed the engineering worksheets and drawings for the Maus turret at Krupp works at Essen. A second raid, couple of months later, effectively killed the project.\n\n\nMax Armor: 220mm\nMax Engine: 1200 HP"
